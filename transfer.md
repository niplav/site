Transfer Learning in Humans
============================

What We're Looking For
-----------------------

Given a broad set of skills `$S$`, I was looking for an intervention/a
set of interventions `$I$` which has the following properties:

1. After applying `$I$`, an average adult can now learn skills from `$S$` is on average much faster counterfactually to not having applied `$I$`
2. Applying `$I$` is easier than learning all skills `$S$`
3. Optional: `$I$` is *relatively* easy to apply, that is it doesn't need a lot of institutional setup
4. Optional: `$I$` can be applied to the find other interventions that have the same properties
