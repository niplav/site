Transfer Learning in Humans
============================

When learning, one would like to progress faster, and learn things
faster. So it makes sense to search for interventions that speed up
learning, enable using knowledge and knowledge patterns from one learned
domain in a new domain (if appropriate), and make it easier to find
further learning-accelerating techniques.

What I Am Looking For
-----------------------

Given a broad set of skills `$S$`, I was looking for an intervention/a
set of interventions `$I$` which has the following properties:

1. After applying `$I$`, an average adult can now learn skills from `$S$` is on average much faster counterfactually to not having applied `$I$`
2. Applying `$I$` is easier than learning all skills `$S$`
3. Optional: `$I$` is *relatively* easy to apply, that is it doesn't need a lot of institutional setup
4. Optional: `$I$` can be applied to itself, and to find better interventions `$I'$` that have the same properties as `$I$`

### Straightforward Stuff

I found several studies from psychology, especially educational
psychology.

[Dunlosky et al.
2017](https://www.wku.edu/senate/documents/improving_student_learning_dunlosky_2013.pdf)
reviewed the evidence on ten proposed effective learning techniques,
and singled out two interventions as having high utility and three
interventions as having moderate utility:

1. High utility:
	1. Practice testing: Testing oneself on the target domain in a low-stakes context, ideally repeatedly. Think [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) with flashcards, or preparing for exams by doing exams from previous years. They mention that practice testing generalizes across formats (e.g. from simple recall to short answer inference tests).
	2. Distributed practice: Practice that happens spread out over a longer amount of time, instead of cramming. This gain is also captured via [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition). They do not mention any transfer benefits here.
2. Moderate utility:
	1. Elaborative interrogation
	2. Self-explanation
	3. Interleaved practice
