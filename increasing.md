feel as long as possible?__

Increasing Subjective Lifespan
================================

[Existing](http://theoryengine.org/life/tips-for-a-longer-life/)
[investigations](https://www.wikihow.com/Slow-Down-Time)
are not well cited, don't consider trade-offs and costs
or effect sizes, given that subjective time is all one has,
it'd be good to have a reliable guide to lengthening it. [Ethan
2023](https://210ethan.github.io/research/slow.html) is the best resource
I currently know of, but a more comprehensive resource including effect
sizes, costs and benefits appears worthwhile to create.

This is *not* about extending healthspan, either by prosaic or
medical interventions, or curing aging, for overview into that see [JackH
2020](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcifQCKkRc9XTjxC2/anti-aging-state-of-the-art)
and [Ricón 2021](https://nintil.com/longevity).

Slowing Down Subjective Experience of Time

Reducing Time Slept
--------------------

[Harsimony 2021](https://harsimony.wordpress.com/2021/02/05/why-sleep/)
argues that we should reduce sleep need, pointing out that these ~30%
of our lives might be better spent on other activities, be they conscious
leisure or work.

### Drugs

#### Melatonin

##### Gwern 2019

[Gwern 2019](https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin#tempus-fugit):

> My rule of thumb is melatonin subtracts an hour [of sleep
time]. (I originally guessed at this value, but my Zeo
sleep recordings seem to suggest the value is [more like 50
minutes](https://www.gwern.net/Zeo.html#melatonin-analysis).) That is:
if one slept for 7 hours, one awakes as refreshed as if one had slept
for 8 hours etc. From comparing with others, I think I benefit more than
around two-thirds of people.

<!--TODO: analyze own data-->

#### Others

Selected from [Harsimony 2023](https://harsimony.wordpress.com/2023/01/20/research-areas-for-reducing-sleep-need/):

* Modafinil
* Orexin-A
* Neuropeptide S
* S-Adenosyl methionine
* Sodium Oxybate

### Meditation

#### Kaul et al. 2010

[Kaul et al.
2010](./doc/meditation/science/meditation_acutely_improves_psychomotor_vigilance_and_may_decrease_sleep_need_kaul_et_al_2010.pdf)
find that long-term meditators ~2.5h less at 2.3h meditation/day,
which suggests that one can reap the benefits of meditation while also
increasing the time spent lucid, if one values time in meditation half
as much as other waking time, that still gives
`$1.25h \cdot 365 \cdot 40 =18250h$` additional hours in a 40 year period.

Relation laws of meditation done → hours slept.

### Behavioral Interventions

* Sleep Hygiene
* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
* Polyphasic Sleep
* Unihemispheric Sleep

### Other Interventions

#### Stimulation

* Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation
* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

> Sleep takes up a sizeable fraction of our lives and has major effects on
life quality, making improvements in quality or wakefulness an ethically
relevant topic [2392]. It appears that mutations in the genes DEC2 [1332,
1372], ADRB1[2639], NPSR1 [3113], GRM1 [2640] can enable reductions in
sleep without negative consequences [3137, 3167].][sic]

Making Sleep More Lucid
------------------------

### Lucid Dreaming

#### Behavioral Interventions

> While self-assessed numbers of awakenings, polyphasic sleep and
physiologically validated wake-REM sleep tran- sitions were associated
with lucid dreaming, neither self-assessed sleep quality, nor physiologi-
cally validated numbers of awakenings were.

*–Gott et al., “Sleep fragmentation and lucid dreaming”, 2019*

#### Drugs

* Galantamine (h/t [Chapin](https://twitter.com/sashachapin/status/1743332700143174124))
