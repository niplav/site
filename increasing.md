Increasing Subjective Lifespan
================================

[Existing](http://theoryengine.org/life/tips-for-a-longer-life/)
[investigations](https://www.wikihow.com/Slow-Down-Time) are not well
cited, don't consider trade-offs and costs or effect sizes, given that
subjective time is all one has, it'd be good to have a reliable guide
to lengthening it.

This is *not* about extending healthspan, either by prosaic or
medical intervention, or curing aging, for overview into that see [JackH
2020](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcifQCKkRc9XTjxC2/anti-aging-state-of-the-art)
and [Ricón 2021](https://nintil.com/longevity).

Reducing Time Slept
--------------------

### Meditation

* [Kaul et al. 2010](./doc/meditation/science/meditation_acutely_improves_psychomotor_vigilance_and_may_decrease_sleep_need_kaul_et_al_2010.pdf) find that long-term meditators ~2.5h less at 2.3h meditation/day, which suggests that one can reap the benefits of meditation while also increasing the time spent lucid, if one values time in meditation half as much as other waking time, that still gives `$1.25h \cdot 365 \cdot 40 =18250h$` additional hours in a 40 year period.

### Genes

> Sleep takes up a sizeable fraction of our lives and has major effects on
life quality, making improvements in quality or wakefulness an ethically
relevant topic [2392]. It appears that mutations in the genes DEC2 [1332,
1372], ADRB1[2639], NPSR1 [3113], GRM1 [2640] can enable reductions in
sleep without negative consequences [3137, 3167].][sic]
