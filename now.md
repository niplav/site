Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.html) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.html).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/) like time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Writing
-------

At the moment, I am writing [“Abstinence from Masturbation and
Success from Cold Approach”](./masturbation_and_attractiveness.html)
before gathering data.

Reading
-------

Currently, I am reading the following books:

* Naive Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)

I am reading the following blogs:

* [Essays on Reducing Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org/)
* [Metamoderna](https://metamoderna.org/)

Data Sets
---------

I am currently collecting data on [estimated life
expectancy](./data/estimated_life_expectancy.csv).
