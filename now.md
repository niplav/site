Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.md) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.md).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/) like time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Writing
-------

At the moment, I am writing [Against Applause After Classical
Concerts](./against_applause.md) and collecting more methods for [Two
People on a Planet](./two_people_on_a_planet.md).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am reading the following books:

* An Anarchist FAQ (Iain McKay/Gary Elkin/Dave Neal/Ed Boraas, 2009)
* Strukturalismus – Eine Einführung (Lothar Fietz, 1982)
* Naive Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)
* Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson, 1992)

I am reading the following blogs:

* [Essays on Reducing Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org/)

Archives
--------

I create [chronological indexes](./index.md#Archives) of blogs I like.

Pick Up
-------

I am currently a beginner and not very good. I intend to have a slow
start. At the end of 2019, I will have done ≥100 approaches. In 2020,
I plan to do ≥1000.

Data Sets
---------

I am currently collecting data on [estimated life
expectancy](./data/estimated_life_expectancy.csv) and plan to write an
essay on that sometime in the future.

Translating
