Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.md) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.md).

I am also working on an arbtt (TODO: link) like time tracker: awitt
(TODO: link here).

Writing
-------

At the moment, I am writing [Against Applause After Classical
Concerts](./against_applause.md) and collecting more methods for [Two
People on a Planet](./two_people_on_a_planet.md).

Reading

* An Anarchist FAQ (Iain McKay/Gary Elkin/Dave Neal/Ed Boraas, 2009)
* Strukturalismus – Eine Einführung (Lothar Fietz, 1982)
