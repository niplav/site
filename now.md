Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

Curently I'm mostly working on an expanded version of [Turning Some
Inconsistent Preferences into Consistent Ones](./turning.html).

I'm also conducting a full edit of all texts on the website, which
is turning out to take *way* longer than I expected.

### Abandoned

These texts have been (for various reasons) abandoned.

* [Life Improvements in 2030](./life_improvements_2030.html)
* [Reward Long Content](./reward.html)
* [Third Variable](./third.html)

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Data Collection
----------------

I'm currently just running my usual [data collection](./data.htm),
but not running any experiments at the moment.

Meditation
-----------

* Morning: 15 minutes ānāpānasati, 30 minutes of Mahasi-style noting
* Evening: 60 minutes ānāpānasati

I also want to do more
[integration](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2021/03/threefold-training.html),
and am planning to read up on [core
Transformation](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2019/07/core-transformation.html)
for that purpose.

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* An Infinitely Large Napkin (Evan Chen, 2023)
* Grand Futures (Anders Sandberg, 2023)
* Growth (Vaclav Smil, 2020)
* Sämtliche Gedichte und Balladen (Friedrich Schiller, 1805)
* Statistics with Julia (Hayden Klok/Yoni Nazarathy, 2021)
