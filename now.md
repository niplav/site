Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

Curently I'm mostly working on an expanded version of [Turning Some
Inconsistent Preferences into Consistent Ones](./turning.html),
and sometimes [thinking on how to measure the precision of
forecasts](./precision.md). I am also finishing up a [self-blinded RCT
with caffeine](./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT).

I'm also planning a full edit of all texts on the website, but don't
have a fixed date to get started on that at the moment.

### Abandoned

These have been (for various reasons) abandoned.

* [Life Improvements in 2030](./life_improvements_2030.html)
* [Reward Long Content](./reward.html)
* [Third Variable](./third.html)

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Data Collection
----------------

I am currently running a [self-blinded RCT with
L-Theanine](./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT).

Meditation
-----------

* Morning: 15 minutes ānāpānasati, 30 minutes of Mahasi-style noting
* Evening: 60 minutes ānāpānasati

I also want to do more integration<!--TODO: Romeo Stevens link-->,
and am planning to read Core Transformation (Andreas 1994) for that.

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* An Infinitely Large Napkin (Evan Chen, 2023)
* Die toten Seelen (Nikolai Gogol, 1842)
* Grand Futures (Anders Sandberg, 2023)
* Sämtliche Gedichte und Balladen (Friedrich Schiller, 1805)
* Starting Strength (Lon Kilgore/Mark Rippetoe, 2007)
* Statistics with Julia (Hayden Klok/Yoni Nazarathy, 2021)
* The Machinery of Freedom (David Friedman, 2014)
* Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (John von Neumann/Oskar Morgenstern, 1953)
