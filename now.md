Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I am currently writing more than I should. When I find the time, I slowly
fix the [daygame cost-benefit analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.md),
write the text for the [masturbation and cold approach success
experiment](./masturbation_and_attractiveness.md), pontificate
about [logical correlation](./logical.html), boggle at my own code
for an [n-dimensional diamond-square algorithm](./diamond.html),
and slowly make readable the treatise on [resolving inconsistent
preferences](./resolving.html).

Data Collection
----------------

At the moment I'm not collecting much data beyond [what I usually
gather](./data.md).

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

--------
