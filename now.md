Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I am currently not writing very much. If I find the time, I slowly fix
the [daygame cost-benefit analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.md).

### Abandoned

These texts have been (for various reasons) abandoned.

* [Life Improvements in 2030](./attic/life_improvements_2030.html)
* [Reward Long Content](./attic/reward.html)
* [Third Variable](./attic/third.html)
* [Effective Altruism is a Pareto Frontier of Truth and Power](./attic/eacrit.html)

Data Collection
----------------

At the moment I'm not collecting much data beyond [what I usually
gather](./data.md).

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* An Infinitely Large Napkin (Evan Chen, 2023)
* Bombay. Maximum City (Suketu Mehta, 2005)
* Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmann, 2017)
* Grand Futures (Anders Sandberg, 2023)
* Growth (Vaclav Smil, 2020)
* Schild's Ladder (Greg Egan, 2004)
* SÃ¤mtliche Gedichte und Balladen (Friedrich Schiller, 1805)
* Statistics with Julia (Hayden Klok/Yoni Nazarathy, 2021)
