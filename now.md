Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

When I find the time, I slowly fix the [daygame cost-benefit
analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.md), boggle at my own code for
an [n-dimensional diamond-square algorithm](./diamond.html),
and slowly improve the treatise on [resolving inconsistent
preferences](./resolving.html).

Data Collection
----------------

At the moment I'm not collecting much data beyond [what I usually
gather](./data.md), and running one RCT on Vitamin-D₃ and one RCT on
[lumenators](https://arbital.com/p/lumenators/).

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

--------
