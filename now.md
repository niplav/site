Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Because of this, work on this website is limited to a small part of my
free time. I apologize for the inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I am mostly writing solutions to exercises in the textbooks I'm reading
at the moment.

If I find time inbetween that, I'm refactoring [Range and Forecasting
Accuracy](./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.md) code & text, or expanding
on the following texts:

* [Generalizing the Diamond-Square Algorithm to n Dimensions](./generalizing_diamond_square.html)
* [Leave the Internet](./leave_the_internet.html)
* [Notes on Politics, Especially Economics](./notes_on_politics_especially_economics.html)
* [Notes on Ethics](./notes_on_ethics.html)

I'm also planning an editing of all texts on the website, but that might
take a while.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.html) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.html).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Data Sets
---------

I am currently collecting data on daygame, in order to improve my
[Daygame Cost-Benefit Analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.html).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* Governing the Commons (Elinor Ostrom, 1990)
* Na√Øve Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Stuart Russell/Peter Norvig, 2010)
* The Jazz Piano Book (Mark Levine, 1998)
