Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.html) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.html).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Writing
-------

I'm writing code and text for [Range and Forecasting
Accuracy](./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am reading the following books:

* Naive Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)
* The Complete Works (H. P. Lovecraft, 1915-1959)
* Aus dem Diwan (Dschel훮ladd카n R큰m카, 1256)
