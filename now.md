Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I'm currently very writing-unfocussed. When I get a new idea,
it goes into the [notes](./notes.html) first. I wish I had
time to develop [pergraphs](./pergraphs.html) and [graph
sevolutions](./notes.html#Graph_Sevolutions), unfortunately I don't.

Data Collection
----------------

I'm currently collecting data for our [Orexin-A
experiment](https://manifund.org/projects/orexin-pilot-experiment-for-reducing-sleep-need).

Otherwise I'm not collecting much data beyond [what I usually
gather](./data.md), and in the future continuing an RCT on
[lumenators](https://arbital.com/p/lumenators/).

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
on an LLM-based productivity application called
[perimedes](https://github.com/niplav/perimedes).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired
time tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt), and
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library of and for handling
various forecasting datasets.
