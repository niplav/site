Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is limited to a small part of my
free time. I apologize for the inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I am mostly writing solutions to exercises in the textbooks I'm reading
at the moment.

If I find time inbetween that, I'm expanding on the following texts:

* [Generalizing the Diamond-Square Algorithm to n Dimensions](./generalizing_diamond_square.html)
* [Leave the Internet](./leave_the_internet.html)
* [Notes on Ethics](./notes_on_ethics.html)
* [Notes on Politics, Especially Economics](./notes_on_politics_especially_economics.html)

I'm also planning a full edit of all texts on the website, but don't
have a fixed date to get started on that at the moment.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.html) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.html).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Data Sets
---------

I am currently collecting data on daygame, in order to improve my
[Daygame Cost-Benefit Analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.html).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* Naïve Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)
* Reactive Systems (Anna Ingólfsdóttir/Jiří Srba/Kim G. Larsen/Luca Aceto, 2007)
* The New Strategic Selling (Stephen E. Heiman/Diane Sanchez/Tad Tuleja, 1995)
* Dune Messiah (Frank Herbert, 1969)
