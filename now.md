Now
====

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way that enables me to work on my personal
projects full-time (including, but not limited to, this website).

Because of this, work on this website is currently limited to a small
part of my free time. I apologize for any inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I am mostly writing solutions to exercises in the textbooks I'm reading
at the moment.

### Currently Writing

If I find time inbetween that, I'm expanding on the following texts:

* [Notes](./notes.html)
	* [Notes on Ethics](./notes_on_ethics.html)
	* [Notes on Pickup](./notes_on_pickup.html)
	* [Notes on Politics, Especially Economics](./notes_on_politics_especially_economics.html)
* [Reports](./reports.html)
	* [Pickup Reports](./pickup_reports.html)
* Forecasting
	* [Precision of Sets of Forecasts](./precision.html)
	* [Forecasters! What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?? Let's Find Out!](./forecasters.html)
* [Prepare to Leave the Internet](./leave.html)
* [Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach](./masturbation_and_attractiveness.html)
* [Turning Some Inconsistent Preferences Into Consistent Ones](./turning.html)
* [Generalizing the Diamond-Square Algorithm to n Dimensions](./diamond.html)
* [Circle Combinations](./circle_combinations.html)
* [Types & Methods of Data Collection I Use](./data.html)
* [If I Were An Eccentric Trillionaire](./eccentric.html)

I'm also planning a full edit of all texts on the website, but don't
have a fixed date to get started on that at the moment.

### Abandoned

These have been (for various reasons) abandoned.

* [Life Improvements in 2030](./life_improvements_2030.html)
* [Reward Long Content](./reward.html)
* [Third Variable](./third.html)

Programming
-----------

Most of my programming time is spent improving
[iqisa](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa), a library for handling various
forecasting datasets. It's also, miraculously, my day job.

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am actively reading the following books:

* Darf man Tiere essen? (Plutarch, 100)
* Die toten Seelen (Nikolai Gogol, 1842)
* Naive Set Theory (Paul R. Halmos, 1960)
* SÃ¤mtliche Gedichte und Balladen (Friedrich Schiller, 1805)
* Maths for Intelligent Systems (Marc Toussaint, 2022)
* Introduction to Optimization (Marc Toussaint, 2022)
