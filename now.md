Now
===

Currently, my main focus is on getting my life in order. That includes
shifting into an equilibrium mode where I am independent and have
structured my life in a way I consider desirable.

Because of this, work on this website is limited to a small part of my
free time. I apologize for the inconveniences.

Writing
-------

I'm writing code and text for [An Exploratory Toy AI Takeoff
Model](./toy_ai_takeoff_model.html), and sporadically updating
[Considerations on Cryonics](./considerations_on_cryonics.html),
[Masturbation and Attractiveness](./masturbation_and_attractiveness.html),
[Range and Forecasting Accuracy](./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html),
and [Daygame Cost-Benefit
Analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.mddaygame_cost_benefit.html).

I'm also planning an editing of all texts on the website, but that might
take a while.

Programming
-----------

My main focus in programming is working on the [99
Klong Problems](./99_klong_problems.html) and their
[solutions](./99_problems_klong_solution.html).

I am also working on an [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/)-inspired time
tracker: [awitt](https://github.com/niplav/awitt).

Mathematics
-----------

I'm eternally working through and [solving the exercises
of](./naive_set_theory_solutions.html) Naive Set Theory.

Data Sets
---------

I am currently collecting data on daygame, in order to improve my
[Daygame Cost-Benefit Analysis](./daygame_cost_benefit.html).

Reading
-------

Currently, I am reading the following books:

* Compassion, by the Pound (F. Bailey Norwood/Jayson L. Lusk, 2011)
* Moral Uncertainty (William MacAskill/Krister Bykvist/Toby Ord, 2020)
* Programming in Lua (Roberto Ierusalimschy, 2013)
* The Human Predicament (David Benatar, 2017)
