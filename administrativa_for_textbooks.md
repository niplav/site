> __I sometimes read textbooks, and create some stuff while reading
them (e.g. making flashcards of facts & definitions in the textbook
and solving some exercises). I collect that information here, to my and
maybe others' benefit.__

Administrativa for Textbooks
============================

For flashcards, if I include the screenshot of an algorithm, the goal
is not to learn the algorithm by heart in all detail, but have a good
mental model of how it works.
