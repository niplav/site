> __I sometimes read textbooks (broadly defined as "a book with
exercises"), and create some stuff while reading them (e.g. making
flashcards of facts & definitions in the textbook and solving some
exercises). I collect that information here, to my and maybe others'
benefit.__

Administrativa for Textbooks
============================

<!--TODO: Add Programming in Lua-->

For flashcards, if I include the screenshot of an algorithm, the goal
is not to learn the algorithm by heart in all detail, but have a good
mental model of how it works.

“Causality”
-----------

Strictly speaking, “Causality” by Judea Pearl is not a textbook,
since it does not include exercises. It is nonetheless included here
because I wrote flashcards for it.

* [Flashcards](./flash/causality.apkg)
	* p. 1-125 (replacing P with hat with Ṗ and x with hat with ẋ for the simple reason that I couldn't find a way to make MathJax create the former)
