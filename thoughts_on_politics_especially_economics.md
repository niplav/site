> __After a discussion with a friend of mine, I thought it would be
useful to structure my current thoughts about politics and economics
in order to speed up my progress on that topic. Many of these points
are only rough ideas, or me collecting unrelated ideas I find good and
useful. Therefore, this text might already be out of date.__

Thoughts on Politics, Especially Economics
===========================================

Before I Get to the Object-Level Stuff
---------------------------------------

What can be done before talking about object-level policies.

### Improve Political Epistemology

Forecasting, track records, public rationality.

Making politicians resonsible if they don't fulfill their promises.

### Copy What Successful Countries are Doing

### This Text Is About Doing Even Better (Maybe)

What Politics Is For
---------------------

Maximize aggregate preferences of humans currently living in the country
(as citizens).

Not (although that would be nice) The One True Good Consequentialism,
or Our Best Guess of Morality With Moral Uncertainty, since you can't
coordinate around that.

### This Is Not An Adequate View!

I know. People don't really have stable, coherent preferences.

<!--TODO: The case against economic values in the brain.-->

However, it's the best model I know of.

How deep does this instability & incoherence go?

[Arrhenius
2000](./doc/population_ethics_impossible/an_impossibility_theorem_for_welfarist_axiologies_arrhenius_2000.pdf)
gives one answer.

### Then How Do We Find These Preferences?

Ask people. Maybe quadratic voting on different metrics.

Caveat: Empirical Versus Theoretical Knowledge About Politics/Economics
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Biases More Prevalent on the Object Level, Right?

### A Lot of Empirical Knowledge About Politics Might Not Be Useful

More just signals.

### How To Evaluate?

Assumptions
-----------

### Economic Progress is Usually Good

#### How Much Do People Value Economic Progress?

#### How Much Would People Value Economic Progress if They Knew More?

#### How Good Is Economic Progress?

Has been so far.

Although caveats with regulation/taxation/x-risk

Having no growth kicks people back into zero-sum dynamics

### Markets are (at least at the Moment) Mostly Aligned

Alignment of markets is >90%.

Different Aspects of Libertarianism
------------------------------------

### Amount of Regulation

### Amount of Taxation

### Amount of Redistribution

### Amount of Inequality

Four (Maybe Five) Problems With Pure Libertarianism
----------------------------------------------------

### Externalities

### Funding Public Goods

#### How Much Are Public Goods?

E.g. is animal suffering in factory farming a public good?

#### Okay, But What Are Public Goods Really?

The definition seems kind of hard to pin down exactly.

#### Different People Consider Different Things Public Goods

Aggregate their preference vectors linearly.

Harsanyi's theorem!

### Human Manipulation and Addiction

### Increasing Marginal Returns

Many economists believe diminishing marginal returns, what reasons do
they have?

### Asymmetric Information

Two Taxes I Like, One I Dislike, And One I'm Unsure About
---------------------------------------------------------

### Taxes I Like

#### Harberger Taxes

#### Pigou Taxes

Problem: Hard to compute.

### Taxes I Dislike

#### Exchange Taxes

Stifling pareto improvements.

### Unsure

#### Land-Value Taxes

<!--What about income taxes, progressive or flat?-->

The Problems With Regulation
-----------------------------

### Regulations Are Usually Not Tested

### Regulations Are Usually Very Inflexible

### Regulations Are Usually Not Retracted

> Market based decision are quite different to those made by
governemnts. If a firm offers a product that nobody wants, it soon
leaves business. If government enacts a bad policy, rarely is it
repealed. Instead, lip service is given to reform, and when the reform
fails, more reform is pursued.  Take, for example, farm support policies,
which were enacte d to provide financial assistance to struggling farmers
during and after the Great Depression. Henry Wallace, the Secretary
of Agriculture from 1930 to 1940, argued that the farm subsidies
were, “*a temporary solution to deal with an emergency*.”² But
even though the average farm household income now exceeds that of the
average US household, and even tough there are now many fewer farmers,
farm policies persist.

*–F. Bailey Norwood/Jayson L. Lusk, “Compassion, by the Pound” p. 323, 2011*

How Much To Redistribute is an Empirical Question
--------------------------------------------------

Heuristic against: Disincentivizes production, since more redistribution
makes production more like a public good, and public goods are hard
to fund.

Heuristic against: People _do_ seem motivated by large amounts of money.

Heuristic in favour: There are strong social incentives for people to
want to work.

Heuristic in favour: Shlegeris says so.

Some Low-key Utopias
---------------------

### A-Btopia

Test your damn laws.

### Decaytopia

At least it's not forever.

### Futarchy

Spectrum from "Politicians sometimes look at prediction markets" to
"“What do you mean by politicians? We quadratically vote our values,
then the markets optimize for us.”"/Raikoth

#### Problems With Futarchy

##### Correlation of Payout-Currency and Policies

Possible solution: create a stable independent currency (maybe with
crypto, isn't there a Wei currency that tries to achieve this?)

##### Goodhardts Law

Mild optimization by reducing size/funding for prediction markets.

Resulting problem: this makes manipulation easier.

##### Reward Hacking

Don't know how to approach this one, maybe secret cabal of data
collectors? Data collectors are not allowed to trade?

#### Approval-Directed Futarchy?

Select n random people (something like 10k, or 0.01% of the population),
ask them how much they approve of the governing in the last year (or
whatever timespan the prediction markets operate on). Try to optimize
that measure.

Miscellania
------------

### Democracy

#### Democracy Is Good For One Thing We Don't Really Use It For

Discovering values, not policies.

#### Modern Democracies Are Highly Indirect For A Reason

#### Voting Is Participating In A Public Good

### Inequality

#### Inequality Might be About Grabbing

#### Why So Specific Inequality?

### Most Complaints About Capitalism are Complaints About Other People Not Caring

### Unions Seem Good, Let's Regulate Them Like Companies!

Use the same cartel laws for unions as for companies.

### Regulate/Tax Companies Proportional to Size

### Nate Soares Should Release His Notes on this Topic

### Some Infuriating Arguments Related to Economics

#### “If We Fix Climate-Change and it Wasn't A Concern, We Will Have Lost Nothing”

Opportunity cost, huge: around $100b per year.

This is not to say that I believe climate change to be harmless,
I don't, and currently believe the recommendations in [Marblestone
2019a](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-1-review-of-basics/),
[Marblestone
2019b](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/)
and [Marblestone
2019c](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-3-other-interventions/)
to be reasonable (although geoengineering seems quite dangerous, and
should probably only be used as a last measure, if at all).

#### “We Should Regulate Companies Rather Than Encouraging Individual Actions”

Regulating companies propagates down higher prices to customers, since
what you want to regulate is more ineffective than current practices
(i.e. costs more).

There are other reasons why regulating companies might be better (more
concentrated leverage points, more fine-grained control).

But there's no free lunch here, people will probably suffer because
of this.
