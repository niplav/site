### Criteria

My most important criteria for choosing software are simplicity,
consistency and durability.

[Simplicity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/) here means mostly [simplicity of
implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better), though
in reality there is very little difference between software with a simple
design&interface and software that only has a simple implementation. Most
of the time, simplicity can be roughly approximated in the total number
of [sloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) used to
implement the software.

[Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(user_interfaces)#List_of_the_cognitive_dimensions)
is even more difficult to define and classify than simplicity.
Broadly speaking, consistency is dependent on symmetry (every input
method has a corresponding output method and vice versa, for example)
and generally a lack of "surprise" when using the software (that is,
most parts of the software are similar in structure, but not content,
to each other). A good example of inconsistency is found in programming
languages with a unary `+`, but not a unary `-`, or programs with vastly
different naming conventions. Perhaps consistency can be thought of as
a certain type of symmetry; if not that, then at least symmetry plays
a big role in consistent systems.

[Durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability), by comparison,
is quite easy to explain. It simply describes the amount of [bit
rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) that occurs in the
given software over time. This includes the probability that it will
be maintained for a long time, and the durability and number of its
dependencies. A good example for durable software is correct C code. It
still compiles and runs after decades of neglect, though often not
without warnings (platform specific C code is of course less durable).

As a result of this, the programs I use mostly come from the
[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)/[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)
ecosystem.

Hardware
--------

I tend not to care very much about hardware, except for compatibility
problems. Nearly all of my computing could be done on a [Raspberry
Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), or on a generic mildly
priced new laptop. I like the Raspberry Pi because of its ability to run
a wide variety of operating systems, but beyond that hardware is rarely
a bottleneck for me. I do care about peripherals, though.
