Software

### List of Programs

* Operating system: Void Linux
* Window manager: dwm
* Terminal emulator: st
* PDF reader: mupdf
* Browser: firefox
* Editor: vis

### Criteria

My most important criteria for choosing software are simplicity,
consistency and durability.  Simplicity here means mostly simplicity
of implementation (TODO: link to New Jersey style of software
development), though in reality there is very little difference between
software with a simple design&interface and software that has a simple
implementation. Most of the time, simplicity can be roughly approximated
in the total number of loc (TODO: link here) used to implement the
software.
