99 Problems Collection
======================

Problems with Solutions
-----------------------

The original list was written by Werner
Hett for the Prolog programming language and later
[re-organized](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).
Most translations into other languages use the old ordering, which only
contains 88 problems, due to both sub-problems and gaps in the order.

* [Elm](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/99_Elm_Problems/1_to_99), 1-22 solved
* [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), all solved
* [K](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/wiki/K-99:-Ninety-Nine-K-Problems), 1-39 solved
* [Lisp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/%7Emeidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html), partially solved
* [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html), mostly solved
* [Scala](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/), mostly solved
