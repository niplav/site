### Arguments

* Why Still Choose C?
	* Long-term reliability/stability
	* Performance
	* Portability
	* → Caveat: Only portable if very reliably/portably written
* Unix is Not About Reimplementing Unix
	* Examples for claim:
		* [Node JS](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs)
		* [The Internet](https://victorops.com/blog/internet-age-unix-philosophy/)
		* [Vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/22w1li/a_fair_comparison_between_vim_and_emacs/cgqyqst/)
		* https://gist.github.com/rjsteinert/f3823f3cdc9971779c17
	* ["Do one thing, and do it well. Use text streams, since that is the universal interface"](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)
	* Most systems reimplement unix ("Those who don't understand unix are doomed to reimplement it, poorly.")
* Libertarianism is too Simple
	*	Libertarianism is a very simple method of organising society,
		so it must have been tried in the history of societies. However,
		none of those societies have survived, which makes it an
		unsuccessful way of structuring societies
	* Counter-argument: Humans are consistently biased against liberty
	*	Counter-argument: Libertarianism is very well suited for
		*modern* (capitalist, technological) societies, which haven't
		existed for very long
* Antinatalism and Consent
* Limit “Philosophy” and “Art”
* Against Advertising
	* Strong claim: Advertising is always bad
	* Weak claim: Advertising in public spaces is bad
	* Does this hold up to a good consequentialist calculation?
* Against News
	* Priming → News+Wikipedia≤Wikipedia
* On the Importance of
	* Qualia Engineering
	* Track Records, Forecasting and Prediction Markets
	* The Difference in Sexual Behavior Between Men and Women
	* Pick Up
		* Combines Near (Sex) with Far (Abstract thinking)
* In Favor of Selling Glee
	* Pointing out problems with the ideas in [The Price Of Glee In China](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/)
	*	General idea: When you find out that making people wealthier
		doesn't make them happier, you start thinking about how to make
		them happier instead of trying to find reasons why making them
		wealthier is still a good idea.
	* Read the post carefully
	* Read up on the research
	* Perhaps re-emphasize as "Easterlin's Paradox"?
* Missing the Movement
	* "Most Hedonists end up sad!"
	* "Utilitarianism leads to bad results!"
	* "Rationalism leads to believing wrong things!"
	* Related text: [Incremental Progress and the Valley](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pvim9PZJ6qHRTMqD3/p/oZNXmHcdhb4m7vwsv)
* In Favor of Gish-Gallop
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop
* An Anthropic Argument in Favour of Eventual Existential Security
	*	Worlds in which existential risk eventually declines contain
		more observer-moments than worlds in which existential risk
		becomes or stays very likely.
	*	Therefore, we're more likely to be in a world where
		there are more observer-moments and we're in world 1
	*	This doesn't work: your reference class is not just
		people ever living, but people looking back on a
		population of X
	* Abandon or rephrase as a something learned
* Forecasting is Worse is Better
* Why not Earlier Forecasting?
	* Maybe not Big Advantage?
	* Needs Infrastructure: Takes months/years to bring fruits
	* People would be wrong
	* Focus on explicit models instead
* Forecasting, Science and Crystal Balls
* Forecasting Contra Credentials
	* Forecasting Stays Relevant to the Topic
	* Forecasting Remembers, the Public May Not
	* Forecasting has Faster Feedback
	* Is Forecasting Harder to Game?
	* Less Susceptible to Social Biases like Charisma
* The Hedonic Treadmill and Politics
	* Inequality
	* Pareto Improvements
	* Hedonic Treadmill
	* Progress
	* Easterlin's Paradox
	* Status Games
* In Praise of Cost-Benefit Analyses

		* energy production
			* nuclear, probably
	* base of the tower probably square
		* length 5-10 km
	* pyramid shaped
		* 100 m for every layer, 20-50m distance to the edge of the last layer
	* big blocks
		* use lava to form them, from pulverized mountains

### Ideas

* Ends of Discussions
	* Dissolving the question
		* Discussion about the meaning of a word
		* Disagreement about an arbitrary category (morality/aethetics)
	* Bet
	* Agreement
	* Related to "Varieties of Argumentative Experience"
* The End of History Fallacy
* The “If Everyone Just” Argument
	* The argument just assumes one of the biggest problems away: coordination and cooperation
	* Related: [Malthusianisms](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=418)
	* Related: https://squareallworthy.tumblr.com/post/163790039847/everyone-will-not-just
* Information and Markets:
	* Explanation
		* Information as a non-scarce good
	* Existing solution
		* Copyright
		* Patents
	* Problems with patents/copyright
		* creates a temporary monopoly
		* → all regular problems with monopolies as result
			* no competition
			* therefore, less/no innovation
			* higher prices
			* prevention of further work based on the innovation
			*	copying is inherent to (all but quantum) information,
				preventing it is theoretically (and for the most part also
				practically) impossible
			*	possible overcompensation: some people get a lot more money
				than appropriate for the work they put in, some get nothing
			* it's ontologically confused
	* Possible solutions:
		* Pay for production
			* Patreon
			* Kickstarter
		* Premium models
		* Advertising
			* Problem: getting harder the more products come into the information domain
		* Open-source model: free work
	* This is essentially a discussion about how to finance public goods
* Aesthematics
	* Infinite Fractal Meta Recursion
		* This is possibly just the ordinal numbers
	* Mendeljew Operator
	* Supersymmetric Copying
* Preference Frustration Auctions
* The Tyranny of the Mill
	* The Hedonic Treadmill is very good & very bad
* Moral progress as an EA cause area?
	* Just Global Priorities Research, dummy
* Writing system based on all binary trees with maximal height 2
	* no 's' sounds
* Moving the Lever Closer
	*	Due to an asymmetry in human decision making, making somebody
		causally more responsible for a negative action makes them less
		likely to take that action
	* Related: The bystander effect
* Salty fries
	* Buy something, that creates a need for something else (software <-> support, salty fries <-> drinks)
* Running Away from Your Problems
	* Examples (?)
		* Anti-biotics
		* de Grey anti-aging proposal
* Cryptographic Agreement on Bribing
* Encoding Conditionals Using Modulo
* Extracting Probabilities from Stock Markets
* Population Ethics Test Suite
	* Look at comments on An Impossibility Theorem for Welfarist Axiologies (Gustaf Arrhenius, 2000)
* Three-level population ethics
	* Symmetrical critical level
	* If any life below -critlevel, level 3
	* If all lifes above critlevel, level 1
	* Otherwise level 2
	* Average in Level 2, total in Level 1/3?
	* Prevents hijacking through efficient just-positive lives
	* Violates Mere Addition Principle
	* Has a symmetry (critlevel & -critlevel are symmetric), but also 2 discontinuities
	*	Also somewhat counter-intuitive: Adding a person with
		critlevel-ε can make a populations welfare infinitely
		worse
	* Of course, still repugnant conclusion with critlevel+ε, but that's okay
	*	But also many -critlevel+ε lives infinitely better than one
		life -critlevel-ε (actively repugnant conclusion)
	*	And also one person with critlevel+ε infinitely better
		than many with critlevel-ε
	* tlpe::{:[(&/x)<-cl;+/x:|(-cl)<(&/x)<cl;ω++/x;(2*ω)++/x}
* Auras as synesthesia between visual perception and emotional perception
	* Maybe a survey?
* Another view on takeoff speeds in relation to the shape of optimization-space

### Collections

* Simple Unsolved Math Problems
* Differences Between GNU and POSIX `make`
* Better Mathematical Notation
	*	Mathematical notation is not a planned and systematic
		endeavour, but the result of a long process of generation
		and selection of different notations. Here I collect
		contemporary ideas for better notation, and discuss old &
		discarded methods of writing mathematics.

### Misc

* Evolution as a Tautology
	* Structures that are Better at Self-Replication will Eventually be More Common than the Ones Which are Not
* Very Specific Psychedelic Qualia
	* №1: “Inverse Capgraps Syndrome”
		*	You locate a specific person while also being fully able to understand
			that the person is not visible, audible, and can not be felt or smelled.
			For example, you would say: "I perceive Steven sitting on the chair"
			while not seeing Steven, hearing or feeling him, and being fully aware
			of these facts.

		status bars etc. I read this proposal a few years back,
		but can't find it again.
	*	Programming languages without operator precedence:
		APL/K/J. Why? One less detail to keep in mind, structured
		data flow. Downside: Inconsistency with mathematics,
		not relevant in languages with little use of operators.
	*	Status tags ({prototype, in progress, maintenance,
		finished, hiatus, abandoned}) for open source projects.

Programming
-----------

* cap
	*	simple language for assembling different files into one. syntax very
		sed/ed like, mostly like this: `[line,]line@file[<|^|>][line,]line[|comm]`
		where line is a regex enclosed in '/' with an optional number suffix
		or a line number, file is a filename and comm is a shell command in
		single quotes. the text from each file is inserted into a buffer and
		printed at the end of the cap script.
* toc
	*	time out cat, which prints its input unless there was no
		input for more than argv[1] seconds (try different
		versions, settle for the most exact version that is
		not unbearably slow).
* lvst
	* print levensthein distances of strings
	* option '-f' for the field separator
	* can be used for fuzzy search
	* usage:

			$ lvst "test"
			foo
			3:test:foo
			bar
			4:test:bar

* cy
	* A very simple version control system, written in rc. inspiration from put and get, from "the unix programming environment".
	* supports 3 operations
		* init (initialize a repository)
		* put (make a commit)
		* get (go back to a certain commit)
	* tracks changes within files and deletion/creation of files
	* reason: git/hg are good, but way too huge for private, simple, linear, personal repositories.
	* inspiration: svn/rvn/eie<!--TODO: links for these-->
* fle
	* suckless pager
	* commands
		* [f]orwards
		* [b]ackwards

* sif
	* simple text processing filter that takes only one instruction
	* (single instruction filter)
	* instruction form:
		* `[^]/str/[,[^]/str/]((a|i|c)/str/)|d|p`
		* str is a literal string here (no regex)
		* a=>append, i=>insert, c=>change, d=>delete, p=>print
		* '^' means that the following str is excluded from the matched text
	* sif does not do input/output buffering and does treat whitespace as any other character.
	* normally, everything is printed, unless the option '-n' is used.
* pau
	* vis-digraph reads from the terminal input directly and emulates the input of the corresponding character
		* uses table from RFC 1345

	*	`<word1> <word2>[TAB]` expands `<word2>` into the last word
		(string separated from the others with a newline/space)
		beginning with `<word2>`
	*	no input for more than half a second/a second shows a suggestion
	        of the last command beginning with the current line.

### Contributions

* mupdf
	* implement unicode search
	* improve search overall, lacking
	* why don't ← and → work for next/prev page?
* myrddin
	* documentation: "and modern features with a high cost-benefit ratio"
	* cost/benefit is high? Clarify
* vis
	* add C-a and C-e for beginning of line and end of line in insert mode
	* add C-← and C-→ for jumping words in insert mode (equivalent of b and e)
	* fix syntax highlighting for ocaml with single quotes: 'a takes the whole line
	* Syntax highlighting of inline code in markdown is annoying (dark blue background!)
* sad
	* implement features that weren't finished
	* care for it
* toxcore
	* maybe
	* single/group
	* chat/audio/video
	* not much more, really
* neo2
	* port neo2 to plan9/9front/Haiku OS
* klong
	* receiving output of shell commands via pipe
	* receiving output of shell commands (maybe via pipe?)
	* self adverb (options are :!, :&, :,, :;, :<, :>, :?)
		* :< and :> should be reserved for something symetric
		* :; is not fit because ; is not really a verb or adverb
		* :!, :&, :? and :, are the best options
	* support for imaginary numbers?
	* nplot
		* Support for multiple bargraphs
		* Bargraphs with negative values
		* Logarithmic scales for graphs
		* setrgb doesn't work properly: after setting the color once, it can only be reset to black
		* Example:

				.l("nplot")
				grid([0 100 10];[0 100 10])
				text(250;60;"Foo")
				setrgb(0;0;1)
				text(200;250;"Bar")
				setrgb(1;1;0)
				text(100;100;"Baz")
				draw()

	* nstat
		* n% confidence interval
		* polynomial/exponential/logarithmic (?) fit for a dataset
	* Range is extremely slow for anything but integers, why?
	* error with klong: `#'s58'!40` returns `kg: error: call: type error: [6 :triad %call1 %pop1]`
		* bug, report
	* Pivot in the gauss/elim implementations
* fzf
	* Why doesn't fzf cope well with shuffled or repeated letters?
	* 'niiiiiplav' and 'nlapiv' both take me to the wrong directory, they're obviously meant for my home directory
* dc 9base manpage:
	* typo in the order of operations in the manpage

> \+  - /  *  %  ^
>      Add subtract multiply divide remainder or exponentiate the top
>      two values on the stack.
