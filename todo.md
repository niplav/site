> __Notes and ideas for texts that will be written decades in the future.__

TODO
====

Site
-----

* Use unicode in every formula that doesn't need MathJax
* Make more mobile-friendly
* Add tooltips to links (Title of Text)
* Find out how to make the site more inclusive

Texts
-----

### Arguments

* Why Still Choose C?
	* Long-term reliability/stability
	* Performance
	* Portability
	* → Caveat: Only portable if very reliably/portably written
* Unix is Not About Reimplementing Unix
* Libertarianism is too Simple
	* Counter-argument: Humans are consistently biased against liberty
* Antinatalism and Consent
* Limit “Philosophy” and “Art”
* Against Advertising
	* Strong claim: Advertising is always bad
	* Weak claim: Advertising in public spaces is bad
	* Does this hold up to a good consequentialist calculation?
* Against News
	* Priming → News+Wikipedia≤Wikipedia

### Analyses

* Modelling the Dream-Time (Population will probably start growing again)
* Considerations on Cryonics
	* Model of when to sign up for Alcor neurocryopreservation
	* Sign up as early as possible
	* Value of a year of life in the future
		* Freedom to die again?
		* How probable is malevolent AI?
		* What about "meh" futures?
		* What about work, friends, language, culture and other circumstances?
		* Prior: The quality of future human life is normally distributed around the neutral case
	* Which methods of revival?
		* Personal identity?
		* If only neuropreservation, where do I get my body from?
* Dumpster Diving
* Hitch Hiking
* Keyboards
	* Hardware
		* Hands too near each other
		*	Staggered keys maybe increase learning time, possibly
			increase typing time (sqr(2) instead of 1 movement distance)
	* Software
		* Layouts are a problem
		* Two modes: key position on keyboard & character presented by key
* Table Diving
* Walking Barefoot
* Pick Up
	* Direct Number on Street
	* Direct Date on Street
	* Direct Date off Street
* Actuarial tables for dictators

### Ideas

* Ends of Discussions
	* Dissolving the question
		* Discussion about the meaning of a word
		* Disagreement about an arbitrary category (morality/aethetics)
	* Bet
	* Agreement
* The End of History Fallacy
* The “If Everyone Just” Argument
	* The argument just assumes one of the biggest problems away: coordination and cooperation
	* Related: [Malthusianisms](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=418)
* Missing the Movement
	* "Most Hedonists end up sad!"
	* "Utilitarianism leads to bad results!"
	* "Rationalism leads to believing wrong things!"

* Information and Markets:
	* Explanation
		* Information as a non-scarce good
	* Existing solution
		* Copyright
		* Patents
	* Problems with patents/copyright
		* creates a temporary monopoly
		* → all regular problems with monopolies as result
			* no competition
			* therefore, less/no innovation
			* higher prices
			* prevention of further work based on the innovation
			*	copying is inherent to (all but quantum) information,
				preventing it is theoretically (and for the most part also
				practically) impossible
			*	possible overcompensation: some people get a lot more money
				than appropriate for the work they put in, some get nothing
			* it's ontologically confused
	* Possible solutions:
		* Pay for production
			* Patreon
			* Kickstarter
		* Premium models
		* Advertising
			* Problem: getting harder the more products come into the information domain
		* Open-source model: free work
* Infinite Fractal Meta Recursion
* Preference Frustration Auctions
* The Tyranny of the Mill

### Collections

* Differences Between GNU and POSIX `make`

### Blackpill

* On Femcels
* On "Just Be Yourself"
