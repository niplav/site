### Arguments

* Why Still Choose C?
	* Long-term reliability/stability
	* Performance
	* Portability
	* → Caveat: Only portable if very reliably/portably written
* Unix is Not About Reimplementing Unix
	* Examples for claim:
		* [Node JS](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs)
		* [The Internet](https://victorops.com/blog/internet-age-unix-philosophy/)
		* [Vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/22w1li/a_fair_comparison_between_vim_and_emacs/cgqyqst/)
		* https://gist.github.com/rjsteinert/f3823f3cdc9971779c17
	* ["Do one thing, and do it well. Use text streams, since that is the universal interface"](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)
	* Most systems reimplement unix ("Those who don't understand unix are doomed to reimplement it, poorly.")
* Libertarianism is too Simple
	*	Libertarianism is a very simple method of organising society,
		so it must have been tried in the history of societies. However,
		none of those societies have survived, which makes it an
		unsuccessful way of structuring societies
	* Counter-argument: Humans are consistently biased against liberty
	*	Counter-argument: Libertarianism is very well suited for
		*modern* (capitalist, technological) societies, which haven't
		existed for very long
* Antinatalism and Consent
* Limit “Philosophy” and “Art”
* Against Advertising
	* Strong claim: Advertising is always bad
	* Weak claim: Advertising in public spaces is bad
	* Does this hold up to a good consequentialist calculation?
* Against News
	* Priming → News+Wikipedia≤Wikipedia
* On the Importance of
	* Qualia Engineering
	* Track Records, Forecasting and Prediction Markets
	* The Difference in Sexual Behavior Between Men and Women
	* Pick Up
		* Combines Near (Sex) with Far (Abstract thinking)
* In Favor of Selling Glee
	* Pointing out problems with the ideas in [The Price Of Glee In China](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/)
	*	General idea: When you find out that making people wealthier
		doesn't make them happier, you start thinking about how to make
		them happier instead of trying to find reasons why making them
		wealthier is still a good idea.
	* Read the post carefully
	* Read up on the research
	* Perhaps re-emphasize as "Easterlin's Paradox"?
* Missing the Movement
	* "Most Hedonists end up sad!"
	* "Utilitarianism leads to bad results!"
	* "Rationalism leads to believing wrong things!"
	* Related text: [Incremental Progress and the Valley](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pvim9PZJ6qHRTMqD3/p/oZNXmHcdhb4m7vwsv)
* In Favor of Gish-Gallop
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop
* An Anthropic Argument in Favour of Eventual Existential Security
	*	Worlds in which existential risk eventually declines contain
		more observer-moments than worlds in which existential risk
		becomes or stays very likely.
	*	Therefore, we're more likely to be in a world where
		there are more observer-moments and we're in world 1
	*	This doesn't work: your reference class is not just
		people ever living, but people looking back on a
		population of X
	* Abandon or rephrase as a something learned
* Forecasting is Worse is Better
	*	The [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) was invented
		in 1950, [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem)
		was first described in 1763, and [probability
		theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) was properly
		invented at the beginning of the 18th century.
	*	However, attempting to use forecasting to seriously determine the
		probability of future events, training & selecting
		people for their forecasting ability and creating
		procedures that incorporate both intuition-based
		and model-based predictions have only been around
		since the mid 1980s <!--TODO: citation needed-->,
		mostly popularized by the work of [Philip
		Tetlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehpilp_E._Tetlock).
	*	Tetlock-style forecasting is "Worse is Better"
		If we can't develop explicit numerical models, why
		not train people in becoming good at estimating the future,
		but this time with probabilistic estimates?
* Why not Earlier Forecasting?
	* Maybe not Big Advantage?
	* Needs Infrastructure: Takes months/years to bring fruits
	* People would be wrong
	* Focus on explicit models instead
* Forecasting, Science and Crystal Balls
* Forecasting Contra Credentials
	* Forecasting Stays Relevant to the Topic
	* Forecasting Remembers, the Public May Not
	* Forecasting has Faster Feedback
	* Is Forecasting Harder to Game?
	* Less Susceptible to Social Biases like Charisma
* The Hedonic Treadmill and Politics
	* Inequality
	* Pareto Improvements
	* Hedonic Treadmill
	* Progress
	* Easterlin's Paradox
	* Status Games
* In Praise of Cost-Benefit Analyses

### Ideas

* Ends of Discussions
	* Dissolving the question
		* Discussion about the meaning of a word
		* Disagreement about an arbitrary category (morality/aethetics)
	* Bet
	* Agreement
	* Related to "Varieties of Argumentative Experience"
* The End of History Fallacy

	* Related: https://squareallworthy.tumblr.com/post/163790039847/everyone-will-not-just
* Information and Markets:
	* Explanation
		* Information as a non-scarce good
	* Existing solution
		* Copyright
		* Patents
	* Problems with patents/copyright
		* creates a temporary monopoly
		* → all regular problems with monopolies as result
			* no competition
			* therefore, less/no innovation
			* higher prices
			* prevention of further work based on the innovation
			*	copying is inherent to (all but quantum) information,
				preventing it is theoretically (and for the most part also
				practically) impossible
			*	possible overcompensation: some people get a lot more money
				than appropriate for the work they put in, some get nothing
			* it's ontologically confused
	* Possible solutions:
		* Pay for production
			* Patreon
			* Kickstarter
		* Premium models
		* Advertising
			* Problem: getting harder the more products come into the information domain
		* Open-source model: free work
	* This is essentially a discussion about how to finance public goods
* Aesthematics
	* Infinite Fractal Meta Recursion
		* This is possibly just the ordinal numbers
	* Mendeljew Operator
	* Supersymmetric Copying
* Preference Frustration Auctions
* The Tyranny of the Mill
	* The Hedonic Treadmill is very good & very bad
* Moral progress as an EA cause area?
	* Just Global Priorities Research, dummy
* Writing system based on all binary trees with maximal height 2
	* no 's' sounds
* Moving the Lever Closer
	*	Due to an asymmetry in human decision making, making somebody
		causally more responsible for a negative action makes them less
		likely to take that action
	* Related: The bystander effect
* Salty fries
	* Buy something, that creates a need for something else (software <-> support, salty fries <-> drinks)
* Running Away from Your Problems
	* Examples (?)
		* Anti-biotics
		* de Grey anti-aging proposal
* Cryptographic Agreement on Bribing

* Population Ethics Test Suite
	* Look at comments on “An Impossibility Theorem for Welfarist Axiologies” (Arrhenius 2000)
* Three-level population ethics
	* Symmetrical critical level
	* If any life below -critlevel, level 3
	* If all lifes above critlevel, level 1
	* Otherwise level 2
	* Average in Level 2, total in Level 1/3?
	* Prevents hijacking through efficient just-positive lives
	* Violates Mere Addition Principle
	* Has a symmetry (critlevel & -critlevel are symmetric), but also 2 discontinuities
	*	Also somewhat counter-intuitive: Adding a person with
		critlevel-ε can make a populations welfare infinitely
		worse
	* Of course, still repugnant conclusion with critlevel+ε, but that's okay
	*	But also many -critlevel+ε lives infinitely better than one
		life -critlevel-ε (actively repugnant conclusion)
	*	And also one person with critlevel+ε infinitely better
		than many with critlevel-ε
	* `tlpe::{:[(&/x)<-cl;+/x:|(-cl)<(&/x)<cl;ω++/x;(2*ω)++/x}`
* Auras as synesthesia between visual perception and emotional perception

* Refactoring Rational Feelings
	*	Relation between emotions, goals, strategy/planning, moral
		development etc.
* Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm – Taoism and Confucianism?
	* Yang's "Win without fighting" is Wu Wei
* The Argument from Explanation of Intuition
	* When you explain an intuition by its causal origin (e.g. a moral
	one by evolutionary psychology), it often loses its bite
* The "At-the-time best possible forecast"
	* Not literally best possible forecast
	* But for humans at the time with the available information

### Collections

* Differences Between GNU and POSIX `make`
* Better Mathematical Notation
	*	Mathematical notation is not a planned and systematic

### Notes

* Be Liberal in what you Accept, but Conservative in what you Emit
* Believing Something Doesn't Mean You to Tell it to Everyone
* You Actually Don't Need to Convice Idiots
* Hug the Objective
	* When trying to achieve something, work directly on that thing
	* Related to: yak-shaving
	* "Do the real thing" by Scott Young
	* Buffers by Rollo Tomassi
* No One Knows & No One Can Know
	* This argument infuriates me: did you try to find out what people actually know?
* Sometimes People have the same Credences but still Disagree
* Teaching Oneself vs. Being Taught
	* Two different mindsets
* Blogging as an Act of Benevolence
	* Mindset of "making a gift"
* Most People Have No Power At All
	* Therefore it's probably not very important what most people think

### Misc

* Evolution as a Tautology
	* Structures that are Better at Self-Replication will Eventually be More Common than the Ones Which are Not
* Very Specific Psychedelic Qualia
	* №1: “Inverse Capgraps Syndrome”
		*	You locate a specific person while also being fully able to understand
			that the person is not visible, audible, and can not be felt or smelled.
			For example, you would say: "I perceive Steven sitting on the chair"
			while not seeing Steven, hearing or feeling him, and being fully aware
			of these facts.

		* Track records
		* Prediction platforms
		* Prediction markets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market)
		* Decision markets
		* Futarchy
	* Voting methods
		* Approval voting
		* Maybe quadratic voting, although I haven't looked into it too much

			* Which computational complexity?
		* Harberger taxes (COST)
			* The thing Glen Weyl is talking about
	* Sokalling
		* Look up tweet by David Chapman
		* Adversarial submitting of fraudulent papers to journals
	*	Besides stdin, stdout and stderr, add usrin and usrout as
		standard unix files: latter is for confirming decisions,
		status bars etc. I read this proposal a few years back,
		but can't find it again.
	*	Programming languages without operator precedence:
		APL/K/J. Why? One less detail to keep in mind, structured
		data flow. Downside: Inconsistency with mathematics,
		not relevant in languages with little use of operators.
	*	Status tags ({prototype, in progress, maintenance,
		finished, hiatus, abandoned}) for open source projects.
	* Mental tool: How would you solve this if you had a hypercomputer?
		* Unbounded Analysis on arbital, problem relaxation as a tactic on LW

	* Explanation
		* Creation
		* God
		* Heaven
			* Compute "path" of mind from existence in the world as a mathematical shape into n-dimensional (72-dimensional?) ball

	*	A group of AI alignment researchers by accident
		stumbles upon cognitive enhancement and willpower direction
		technologies. Because AGI seems imminent, they reluctanctly start
		using the technology. They manage to always stay a step or two
		ahead of the AI systems growing in capability, but continue
		having to self-modify in order to devise new strategies. The
		world watches as increasingly unaligned alignment researchers and
		unaligned artificial intelligence battle for attainable utility…

Programming
-----------

* cap
	*	simple language for assembling different files into one. syntax very
		sed/ed like, mostly like this: `[line,]line@file[<|^|>][line,]line[|comm]`
		where line is a regex enclosed in '/' with an optional number suffix
		or a line number, file is a filename and comm is a shell command in
		single quotes. the text from each file is inserted into a buffer and
		printed at the end of the cap script.
* toc
	*	time out cat, which prints its input unless there was no
		input for more than argv[1] seconds (try different
		versions, settle for the most exact version that is
		not unbearably slow).
* lvst
	* print levensthein distances of strings
	* option '-f' for the field separator
	* can be used for fuzzy search
	* usage:

			$ lvst "test"
			foo
			3:test:foo
			bar
			4:test:bar

* cy
	* A very simple version control system, written in rc. inspiration from put and get, from "the unix programming environment".
	* supports 3 operations
		* init (initialize a repository)
		* put (make a commit)
		* get (go back to a certain commit)
	* tracks changes within files and deletion/creation of files
	* reason: git/hg are good, but way too huge for private, simple, linear, personal repositories.
	* inspiration: svn/rvn/eie<!--TODO: links for these-->
* fle
	* suckless pager
	* commands
		* [f]orwards
		* [b]ackwards
		* [u]p
		* [d]own
		* [j] (line up)
		* [k] (line down)
		* [g] (first line)
		* [G] (last line)
		* [/] for searching
		* [n]ext and [p]revious match
	* support for arbitrary length files, loading lazily, unicode is displayed properly, big lines are dealt with properly.
* recog
	* program that accepts one backus-naur form grammar and checks if it's input or other files match that grammar.
	* BNF -(Convert to Chomsky Normal Form)> CNF -(Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm)> Boolean
	* Relevant material:
		* RFC 2234
		* RFC 4234
		* RFC 5234
		* RFC 7405
	* Possible BNF forms:
		* ABNF (RFCs)
		* EBNF
		* naive & simple form (similar to the one used on Wikipedia)
			* <symbol\>
			* optionality: '?'
			* repetition: '+'
			* repetition with optionality: '*'
			* alternative symbols: '|'
			* assignment: '::='
			* "string"
* sif
	* simple text processing filter that takes only one instruction
	* (single instruction filter)
	* instruction form:
		* `[^]/str/[,[^]/str/]((a|i|c)/str/)|d|p`
		* str is a literal string here (no regex)
		* a=>append, i=>insert, c=>change, d=>delete, p=>print
		* '^' means that the following str is excluded from the matched text
	* sif does not do input/output buffering and does treat whitespace as any other character.
	* normally, everything is printed, unless the option '-n' is used.
* pau
	* vis-digraph reads from the terminal input directly and emulates the input of the corresponding character
		* uses table from RFC 1345
			* Seems not extendable, damn
	* if vis-digraph extendable, add:
		* Interrobang	‽	?!
		* Join	⋈	><
		* Expected value	𝔼	|E
		* Real numbers	ℝ	|R
		* Integers	ℤ	|Z

	* syntax: `[MOUSEEVENT] [, MOUSEEVENT] [ /*possibly nested*/ COMMAND ]`
* erle
	* rlwrap alternative, takes ideas from the fish shell interactive mode
	* normal readline like behavior (but using something simpler, like linenoise/dietline)
	* history file is loaded during startup
	* 	`<text>[UP]` shows the last command containing `<text>`,
		again `[UP]` the one before that, and so on
	*	`<word1> <word2>[TAB]` expands `<word2>` into the last word
		(string separated from the others with a newline/space)
		beginning with `<word2>`
	*	no input for more than half a second/a second shows a suggestion
		of the last command beginning with the current line.

	* documentation: "and modern features with a high cost-benefit ratio"
	* cost/benefit is high? Clarify
* vis
	* add C-a and C-e for beginning of line and end of line in insert mode

	* care for it
* toxcore
	* maybe
	* single/group

	* receiving output of shell commands via pipe
	* receiving output of shell commands (maybe via pipe?)
	* self adverb (options are :!, :&, :,, :;, :<, :>, :?)
		* :< and :> should be reserved for something symetric
		* :; is not fit because ; is not really a verb or adverb
		* :!, :&, :? and :, are the best options
	* support for imaginary numbers?
	* nplot
		* Support for multiple bargraphs
		* Bargraphs with negative values
		* Logarithmic scales for graphs
		* setrgb doesn't work properly: after setting the color once, it can only be reset to black
		* Example:

				.l("nplot")
				grid([0 100 10];[0 100 10])
				text(250;60;"Foo")
				setrgb(0;0;1)
				text(200;250;"Bar")
				setrgb(1;1;0)
				text(100;100;"Baz")
				draw()

	* nstat
		* n% confidence interval
		* polynomial/exponential/logarithmic (?) fit for a dataset
	* Range is extremely slow for anything but integers, why?
	* error with klong: `#'s58'!40` returns `kg: error: call: type error: [6 :triad %call1 %pop1]`
		* bug, report
	* Pivot in the gauss/elim implementations
* fzf
	* Why doesn't fzf cope well with shuffled or repeated letters?
	* 'niiiiiplav' and 'nlapiv' both take me to the wrong directory, they're obviously meant for my home directory
* dc 9base manpage:
	* typo in the order of operations in the manpage
