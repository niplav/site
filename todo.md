### Arguments

* Why Still Choose C?
	* Long-term reliability/stability
	* Performance
	* Portability
	* → Caveat: Only portable if very reliably/portably written
* Unix is Not About Reimplementing Unix
	* Examples for claim:
		* [Node JS](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs)
		* [The Internet](https://victorops.com/blog/internet-age-unix-philosophy/)
		* [Vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/22w1li/a_fair_comparison_between_vim_and_emacs/cgqyqst/)
		* https://gist.github.com/rjsteinert/f3823f3cdc9971779c17
	* ["Do one thing, and do it well. Use text streams, since that is the universal interface"](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)
	* Most systems reimplement unix ("Those who don't understand unix are doomed to reimplement it, poorly.")
* Libertarianism is too Simple
	*	Libertarianism is a very simple method of organising society,
		so it must have been tried in the history of societies. However,
		none of those societies have survived, which makes it an
		unsuccessful way of structuring societies
	* Counter-argument: Humans are consistently biased against liberty
	*	Counter-argument: Libertarianism is very well suited for
		*modern* (capitalist, technological) societies, which haven't
		existed for very long
* Antinatalism and Consent
* Limit “Philosophy” and “Art”
* Against Advertising
	* Strong claim: Advertising is always bad
	* Weak claim: Advertising in public spaces is bad
	* Does this hold up to a good consequentialist calculation?
* Against News
	* Priming → News+Wikipedia≤Wikipedia
* On the Importance of
	* Qualia Engineering
	* Track Records, Forecasting and Prediction Markets
	* The Difference in Sexual Behavior Between Men and Women
	* Pick Up
* In Favor of Selling Glee
	* Pointing out problems with the ideas in [The Price Of Glee In China](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/)
	*	General idea: When you find out that making people wealthier
		doesn't make them happier, you start thinking about how to make
		them happier instead of trying to find reasons why making them
		wealthier is still a good idea.
	* Read the post carefully
	* Read up on the research
* Missing the Movement
	* "Most Hedonists end up sad!"
	* "Utilitarianism leads to bad results!"
	* "Rationalism leads to believing wrong things!"
	* Related text: [Incremental Progress and the Valley](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pvim9PZJ6qHRTMqD3/p/oZNXmHcdhb4m7vwsv)

### Analyses

* Modelling the Dream-Time (Population will probably start growing again)
* Dumpster Diving
* Hitch Hiking
* Keyboards
	* Hardware
		* Hands too near each other
		*	Staggered keys maybe increase learning time, possibly
			increase typing time (sqr(2) instead of 1 movement distance)
	* Software
		* Layouts are a problem
		* Two modes: key position on keyboard & character presented by key
* Table Diving
* Walking Barefoot
* Pick Up
	* Direct Number on Street
	* Direct Date on Street
	* Direct Date off Street
	* Cost-benefit analysis write-up
* Actuarial tables for dictators
* Ideology Transition Graphs
	* When people move along ideologies, which paths do they take?
	* How long do they stay at certain ideologies?
	* What are the overall transition probabilities, what are the "sinks" (look up on markov chains)
	* Survey on /r/CapitalismVSocialism
	* One part with selected ideologies:
		* Centrism, Apolitical
		* Social Democracy, Socialism, Communism
		* Liberalism, Left Liberalism, Anarchism
		* Libertarianism, Minarchism, Anarcho-Capitalism
		* Conservativism, Alt-Right, National Socialism, Fascism
	* One part with freely choosable ideologies

### Ideas

* Ends of Discussions
	* Dissolving the question
		* Discussion about the meaning of a word
		* Disagreement about an arbitrary category (morality/aethetics)
	* Bet
	* Agreement
* The End of History Fallacy
* The “If Everyone Just” Argument
	* The argument just assumes one of the biggest problems away: coordination and cooperation
	* Related: [Malthusianisms](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=418)
* Information and Markets:
	* Explanation
		* Information as a non-scarce good
	* Existing solution
		* Copyright
		* Patents
	* Problems with patents/copyright
		* creates a temporary monopoly
		* → all regular problems with monopolies as result
			* no competition
			* therefore, less/no innovation
			* higher prices
			* prevention of further work based on the innovation
			*	copying is inherent to (all but quantum) information,
				preventing it is theoretically (and for the most part also
				practically) impossible
			*	possible overcompensation: some people get a lot more money
				than appropriate for the work they put in, some get nothing
			* it's ontologically confused
	* Possible solutions:
		* Pay for production
			* Patreon
			* Kickstarter
		* Premium models
		* Advertising
			* Problem: getting harder the more products come into the information domain
		* Open-source model: free work
* Infinite Fractal Meta Recursion
* Preference Frustration Auctions
* The Tyranny of the Mill
* Moral progress as an EA cause area?
* Script based on all binary trees with maximal height 2
	* no 's' sounds

### Collections

> we should be far more explicit about the assumed background against
> which we intend to communicate.

*– John Nerst, [“30 Fundamentals”](https://everythingstudies.com/2018/07/16/30-fundamentals/), 2018*

### Fiction

* Homeless Super-Mathematicians
	* Perhaps in the SCP format?
* Skalpell Bizeps

> 11-uhr-luft liegt rauh auf dem parkplatzboden.  in den ritzen des
asphalt streitet sich krepierender löwenzahn mit ausgeblichenen
zigarettenstummeln um platz. abblätternde farbe liegt dazwischen,
obwohl die altbauten noch ein paar hundert meter entfernt liegen.

* myzel

> moderne kapitalistische verteilung ist weder zentralisiert noch
dezentralisiert, sie ist myzelisch, verwaberndes, meist unsichtbares
gewebe in einem fruchtbaren umfeld, mit anhäufungen, ballungen und
kumulationen von produktionszentren – zur festigkeit verdichtetes
gewebe dort fassbar, wo es sich am wenigsten äußert. werden als
eine kontingente verschmelzung von fast-sein und konkretheit"

### Translations

Programming
-----------

* cap
	*	simple language for assembling different files into one. syntax very
		sed/ed like, mostly like this: `[line,]line@file[<|^|>][line,]line[|comm]`
		where line is a regex enclosed in '/' with an optional number suffix
		or a line number, file is a filename and comm is a shell command in
		single quotes. the text from each file is inserted into a buffer and
		printed at the end of the cap script.
* toc
	*	time out cat, which prints its input unless there was no
		input for more than argv[1] seconds (try different
		versions, settle for the most exact version that is
		not unbearably slow).
* lvst
	* print levensthein distances of strings
	* option '-f' for the field separator
	* can be used for fuzzy search
	* usage:

			$ lvst "test"
			foo
			3:test:foo
			bar
			4:test:bar

* cy
	* A very simple version control system, written in rc. inspiration from put and get, from "the unix programming environment".
	* supports 3 operations
		* init (initialize a repository)
		* put (make a commit)
		* get (go back to a certain commit)
	* tracks changes within files and deletion/creation of files
	* reason: git/hg are good, but way too huge for private, simple, linear, personal repositories.
	* inspiration: svn/rvn/eie<!--TODO: links for these-->
* fle
	* suckless pager
	* commands
		* [f]orwards
		* [b]ackwards
		* [u]p
		* [d]own
		* [j] (line up)
		* [k] (line down)
		* [g] (first line)
		* [G] (last line)
		* [/] for searching
		* [n]ext and [p]revious match
	* support for arbitrary length files, loading lazily, unicode is displayed properly, big lines are dealt with properly.
* recog
	* program that accepts one backus-naur form grammar and checks if it's input or other files match that grammar.
	* BNF -(Convert to Chomsky Normal Form)> CNF -(Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm)> Boolean
	* Relevant material:
		* RFC 2234
		* RFC 4234
		* RFC 5234
		* RFC 7405
	* Possible BNF forms:
		* ABNF (RFCs)
		* EBNF
		* naive & simple form (similar to the one used on Wikipedia)
			* <symbol\>
			* optionality: '?'
			* repetition: '+'
			* repetition with optionality: '*'
			* alternative symbols: '|'
			* assignment: '::='
			* "string"
* sif
	* simple text processing filter that takes only one instruction
	* (single instruction filter)
	* instruction form:
		* `[^]/str/[,[^]/str/]((a|i|c)/str/)|d|p`
		* str is a literal string here (no regex)
		* a=>append, i=>insert, c=>change, d=>delete, p=>print
		* '^' means that the following str is excluded from the matched text
	* sif does not do input/output buffering and does treat whitespace as any other character.
	* normally, everything is printed, unless the option '-n' is used.
* pau
	* vis-digraph reads from the terminal input directly and emulates the input of the corresponding character
		* uses table from RFC 1345
			* Seems not extendable, damn
	* if vis-digraph extendable, add:
		* Interrobang	‽	?!
		* Join	⋈	><
		* Expected value	𝔼	|E
		* Real numbers	ℝ	|R
		* Integers        ℤ       |Z
		* Natural numbers	ℕ	|N
		* Triple e	≡	3=
		* Approximately e	≈	~~
		* Subscript a	ₐ	_a / as
		* Subscript e	ₑ	_e / es
		* Subscript h	ₕ	_h / hs
		* Subscript k	ₖ	_k / ks
		* Subscript l	ₗ	_l / ls
		* Subscript m	ₘ	_m / ms
		* Subscript n	ₙ	_n / ns
		* Subscript o	ₒ	_o / os
		* Subscript p	ₚ	_p / ps
		* Subscript s	ₛ	_s / ss
		* Subscript t	ₜ	_t / ts
		* Superscript i	ⁱ	^i
		* Superscript n	ⁿ	^n
	* daemon that catches such digraphs and emulates them as if they were typed, using vis-digraph
* mtfs: plan9 file server for a file that returns the current metric time on read

		* :!, :&, :? and :, are the best options
	* support for imaginary numbers?
	* nplot
		* Support for multiple bargraphs
		* Bargraphs with negative values
	* Range is extremely slow for anything but integers, why?

		* bug, report
* dc 9base manpage:
	* typo in the order of operations in the manpage

> \+  - /  *  %  ^
