### Arguments

* Why Still Choose C?
	* Long-term reliability/stability
	* Performance
	* Portability
	* → Caveat: Only portable if very reliably/portably written
* Unix is Not About Reimplementing Unix
* Libertarianism is too Simple
	* Counter-argument: Humans are consistently biased against liberty
* Antinatalism and Consent
* Limit “Philosophy” and “Art”
* Against Advertising
* Against News
	* Priming → News+Wikipedia≤Wikipedia

### Analyses

* Some Considerations on When to Sign Up for Cryonics
	* Model of when to sign up for Alcor neurocryopreservation
	* Sign up as early as possible
* Dumpster Diving

* Walking Barefoot
* Pick Up
	* Direct Number on Street
	* Direct Date on Street

### Ideas

* Ends of Discussions
	* Dissolving the question
		* Discussion about the meaning of a word
		* Disagreement about an arbitrary category (morality/aethetics)
	* Bet
	* Agreement
* The End of History Fallacy
* The “If Everyone Just” Argument
	* The argument just assumes one of the biggest problems away: coordination and cooperation
	* Related: [Malthusianisms](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=418))
* Missing the Movement
	* "Most Hedonists end up sad!"
	* "Utilitarianism leads to bad results!"

	* Related text: [Incremental Progress and the Valley](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pvim9PZJ6qHRTMqD3/p/oZNXmHcdhb4m7vwsv)
* Information and Markets:
	* Explanation
		* Information as a non-scarce good
	* Existing solution
		* Copyright
		* Patents
	* Problems with patents/copyright
		* creates a temporary monopoly
		* → all regular problems with monopolies as result
			* no competition
			* therefore, less/no innovation
			* higher prices
			* prevention of further work based on the innovation
			*	copying is inherent to (all but quantum) information,
				preventing it is theoretically (and for the most part also
				practically) impossible
			*	possible overcompensation: some people get a lot more money
				than appropriate for the work they put in, some get nothing
			* it's ontologically confused
	* Possible solutions:
		* Pay for production
			* Patreon
			* Kickstarter
		* Premium models
		* Advertising
			* Problem: getting harder the more products come into the information domain
		* Open-source model: free work
* Infinite Fractal Meta Recursion
* Preference Frustration Auctions
