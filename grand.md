Comments on “Grand Futures”
============================

### 0.1

> The aim is to develop solid arguments about these
questions, such as bounds on how much computation could be done
given up-to-date physical theory or game-theoretic arguments
that civilizations meeting certain assumptions would behave in
certain ways when they met.

Perhaps change to:

> The aim is to develop solid arguments about these questions, such as
bounds on how much computation could be done given up-to-date physical
theory__,__ or game-theoretic arguments that civilizations meeting
certain assumptions would behave in certain ways __if__ they met.

> Performing more than a __google__ (10<sup>100</sup>) computations

I think it is supposed to be
"__[googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol)__" instead of "google".

> Ord and Cotton-Barrett defined “An existential eucatastrophe is an
event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event
than before.” [684]²

The citation 684 is for "Gravitationally redshifted absorption lines in
the x-ray burst spectra of a neutron star", but I think it should be 685,
"Existential risk and existential hope: definitions". This off-by-one
pattern repeats itself throughout my copy of the book.

### 0.3

> The usage of the term civilization in this book needs to be
disambiguated.  Civilization can be used to denote complex societies
with features such as irrigation, urban areas, social stratification,
symbolic systems of communication, division of labour etc.

Perhaps use quotation marks around "civilization"
here—this feels like a [mention more than a
use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use—mention_distinction).

> I will be using the term civilization not in the narrow high culture
sense but to denote __as__ a cohesive, long-range (social) structure
with a high degree of coordination

Same with quotation here, also the "as" feels stumbly.

### 0.4

> Near-term is more predictable and hence conclusions are more likely
to be true

I don't know of a good resource that firmly establishes this. [Dillon
2020](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/data-on-forecasting-accuracy-across-different-time-horizons)
and my [own investigation](./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html)
don't come to firm conclusions, mostly because of
a dearth of good long-term forecasting data. [Muehlhauser
2019](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting)
also laments the lack of long-term forecasts that are precise enough to
be checked. I think later in the book there will be talk about why less
accurate forecasts should be expected in dynamical systems, and I look
forward to that discussion.

I haven't yet done a full review of that field yet, and my guess is that
there are much better references out there (maybe even on my hard drive).

#### 1.1.4

> While this book certain__ty__ is not intended as science fiction, it
may well find use as a source of raw material for science fiction authors.

Typo, should be "certain__ly__".

#### 1.1.5

> But for having a liveable society with an open future dynamism looks
better.

This sentence tripped me up, twice.
