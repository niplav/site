Perhaps change to:

certain assumptions would behave in certain ways __if__ they met.

> Performing more than a __google__ (10<sup>100</sup>) computations

I think it is supposed to be
"__[googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol)__" instead of "google".

> Ord and Cotton-Barrett defined “An existential eucatastrophe is an
event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event
than before.” [684]²

The citation 684 is for "Gravitationally redshifted absorption lines in
the x-ray burst spectra of a neutron star", but I think it should be 685,
"Existential risk and existential hope: definitions".
