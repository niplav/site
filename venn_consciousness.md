Using Venn Diagrams to Visualize Conceptions of Intelligence, Consciousness and Sentience
=========================================================================================

Relevant Classes
----------------

5 Classes:

* Intelligent
* Sentient
* Conscious
* Information-processing
* Optimzing

#### Descriptions

Terms (short, and only gesturing towards a definition):

*	Information-Processing (I-P): Complex internal state,
	responding to stimuli, processes information (duh!)
	Example: Computer
	Counter-example: Empty space
*	Intelligent (I): Internal model of the world, optimizes
	a goal, makes plans and executes them.
	Example: Adult human, artificial intelligence
	Counter-example: Tree
*	Conscious (C): Has internal self-model, passes mirror test
	(or similar test), can distinguish "world" and "self"
	Example: Myself
	Counter-example: P-Zombie
*	Sentient (S): Can experience valence qualia
	Example: Myself
	Counter-example: P-Zombie
*	Optimizing (O): Optimizes a given goal
	Example: Evolution, Paperclip-maximizer
	Counter-example: A piece of paper

Sapient instead of intelligent? TODO: look up these definitions!

Notation
--------

Notation: Typical for Venn diagram, but if two classes
(e.g. Intelligent and Conscious), it is written as I=C in
the circle.
If a class doesn't mean anything (e.g. Sentient), it can be
written as ¬S in the class it collapses into. If no such class exists, it
can be written outside of all classes, also as ¬S.
