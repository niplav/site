Poems

### English

> Paradises, peacocks, peaches and palimpsests! Prussians, prowlers plus
plumous penguins, priestess parks principles—priceless.

----

> gah, can't snarf evince.

----

> You can sit here and be okay, if you want.

----

> Now hips, a black hole to surround  
no Riemann metric has yet traced  
an old, a new decision is now made  
a bow is drawn  
a good one, as of yet  
no fragmented escutcheon  
from the old master's whirring feet  
a pair of compasses would never  
traverse the geodesic so  
a “hi”, a “no”, a saddest look,  
relieved of possibility  
Now have I fucking traumatized the bird‽

### German

> Ein Wille wie Silizium, ein Auftreten wie Sand, ein Gemüt wie von
Licht durchschienenes Glas.

----

----

Alle Schatten werden schlau

### Senryū

Well, not strictly [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
(not always a cutting word or seasonal reference) or
[senryū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senryū) (not always cynical &
dark or about humans), but I follow the 17 (5-7-5) syllable format.

#### German

Winters Klee entschied  
Einmal mir nachzufolgen  
Bedachte nicht; Pferd!

Kirschblüten gegen  
das samtene Firnament  
bald stürzt es hinab

Doch Blüten, deren  
Topazellbogen plötzlich  
Scharlachknie sind

Amethystschulter,  
die mit Graphitgeste kein  
Kobaltherz verscharrt

##### Lipogrammatisch

Nicht Domizil, nicht  
Humbug, hat dir, Odysseus,  
Schändung nun abzollt

#### English

In the CPU  
Peace. But the tranquility  
is interrupted.

Autumn, slashing when  
The eternal emerald  
Sadly decomposed  

[Backward analyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#Backward_analysis)  
This computation sufficed  
But data? Perturbed  

[Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_\(mathematics\)) are weird and nice  
Where get differentiation?  
Just increase your `$m$`  

In jazz scattering  
Forward, backward, to the side  
confusion entails

Please turn off the lights!  
Very high costs arise, when  
The light is on. Thanks.

May your death be like  
A married bachelor, ex  
falso quodlibet

The silence prickles  
A mind too swift for meaning  
<!--Is Thoughts without wrapping worse? Better?-->
Unwrapping my thoughts

<!--
Some minds start cutting  
themselves, if the do not dull  
themselves in a while

A psyche might start  
cutting itself, if it is  
not dulled each fortnight
-->

A sharp mind might start  
cutting itself, if it ain't  
dulled once in a while

Thus declaring: “read,  
write, code—sit, approach, lift”, off  
into the mountains.

When the elder drop  
Never hits your eye again  
Itching bark quivers

Lest our shimmery  
Streets give no unheard secrets  
I will munge some corn

Hardening over  
Kazakhstani pools, we hence  
Elucidate this

Oscillate northwards,  
Then hold to the nearest points  
Fragmented lesions

Having now observed  
The one year and one day rule  
I can say it's good

##### Lipogrammatic Bukkake Senryūs

It, triumphantly  
giggling, snatched this poisonous  
cum from a mailman

At my spot, I found  
an old spy, cum Trotskyist  
iconography

Just sub a smoking  
cumulonimbus, our work  
now turns arduous

Wrong Quotes

### Misattributed

> All compounded things are subject to vanish. Strive with earnestness.

Stories
--------

> Law of conservation of valence.

----

> Globe-decorated neo-neoliberals furiously fruitlessly arguing with
zero-summers on birdsite, shaman bros helping others get laid at parties
funded by eternal-life cryptomoguls, infra-red haired identity-fractalites
with two dozen Mercedes stars draped over their bodies lecturing pale
soy-skeletons about Cockshottian cybernetics. It is, not exaggerating too
much, a moment exactly fitting the emergence of a second semi-unknown
unknown, only to be faintly perceived by posterior-maximizers who have
trained their sensory organs to the maximal degree of data intake possible
without (at the moment outside of military circles unavailable) BCIs. And
yet, the 'works scale and scale, just as foretold by the 𝔊 prophet.

### Squeal

> *epistemic status: I saw the best minds of my generation*
>  
> Limply balancing mile-deep cocktail glasses and clamoring for laughable Thielbucks on the cramped terraces of Berkely,  
who invite you to the luring bay, promising to pay for your entire being while elegantly concealing the scarlet light evaporating from their tearducts and nostrils,  
who down 3¾ bottles of Huel™ and sprint to their next fellowship or retreat or meetup or workshop, in the pore-showingly lit hallways with whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards,  
who want to crown random nerds with aureal sigmas fished from the manifold crevaces of self-denying deities,  
who write epics of institutionalized autists bent on terraforming these overpopulated hypothetical hells,  
pointing out dynamic inconsistency in the comments and melting hectoton steel-marbles around civilizational recipes,  
who improve their aim hurling yeeting philosophical tomes at unsuspecting passerbys and ascend urban lampposts to loudly deduce their mechanical liturgies,  
who cut down oaks and poppies in the parks to make oil and space for those ones yet to come and who hunker down in fortified coalmines in Montana and the Ruhrgebiet, propelled into the rock by a Ordite reactor, a Bostromite dynamo,  
who exitedly pour & plaster tabulated exponents into webscripted canisters just below the teal-tinded ceiling,  
who can name the 11 AI forecasting organisations and the 4 factors of successful nonprofits and the 7 noble ways of becoming more agentic and might even find Rwanda on a map not made in Silicon Valley,  
contemplating hemispherectomies to purify their nascent idealism on the verge of a hope-ash London dawn,  
who catch a feral heart in the garden behind the A100 rack and save it into a transparent domicile, injecting it with 17000 volts to illuminate all the last battery cages equally,  
who empty out their pockets with uncountable glaring utilons onto innocent climate activists, promising to make them happy neutron stars one day,  
microscopically examining the abyssal monstrosities their oracles conjure up out of the lurching empty chaos,  
who fever towards silver tendrils bashing open their skulls and eating up their brains and imaginations, losslessly swallowed into that ellipsoid strange matter gut pulsing out there between the holes
