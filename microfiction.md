zero-summers on twitter, shaman bros helping others get laid at parties
funded by eternal-life cryptomoguls, infra-red haired identity-fractalites
with two dozen Mercedes stars draped over their bodies lectured pale
soy-skeletons about Cockshottian cybernetics. It is, not exaggerating too
much, a moment exactly fitting the emergence of a second semi-unknown
unknown, only to be faintly perceived by posterior-maximizers who had
trained their sensory organs to the maximal degree of data intake possible
without (at the time outside of military circles unavailable) BCIs. And
yet, the 'works scale and scale, just as foretold by the ùîä prophet.
