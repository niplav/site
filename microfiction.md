### Written While Riding the BART for the First Time

Hello last city on Earth  
the Eastest of the West  
Looking out at your hills you (sort of?) resemble ancient Greece  
And I can almost smell the meteoric ash

Hello Berkeley  
You ambiguous Bastard  
You self-forlorn radical, you  
contradictio in adjecto

Why do *you* already occupy my mind, squatters on my synapses  
A premature hate for having sucked me in already  
What has gotten me yet, what has revealed my purpose  
If not your memetic spewings  
Man if you kill me I'm gonna be real mad for a while  
Where did you put all my friends  
One-shotted by this narcissistic ambitopia

Well well well San Francisco  
I could get out and see you cope for real  
dashed ambitions drowned in B2B SaaS bucks  
An oil platform above the no√∂sphere  
With Capgras spirits stepping over the feces  
The line howls with the squeal of exaQALYs lost

I hope you'll create paradise, and if you do  
that you'll know it was by accident

("Daly city". lmao. does that ever get old?)

### The Arbitrary and The Open Sky

(not mysticism)<!--Maybe mysticism-adjacent?-->

#### The Arbitrary

There is no best programming language for Solomonoff Induction.  
Grue.  
A rock implements every possible finite-state automaton.  
Are you an anti-inductor in an inductive universe? Are you an inductor in an anti-inductive universe?  
Choice of axioms.

Uncommon priors require origin disputes. What do you say during an origin dispute?  

Dust theory.  
No natural measure in Tegmark IV.  
Where was your mind before you were created in motion?  

Future Tuesday Indifference.  
Quinean underdetermination. Infinite theories fit the same data.

##### Anti-Arbitrary

* Finite Factored Sets (Garrabrant)
* Natural Latents (Wentworth & Lorell)

#### The Open Sky

Feeling in the dark for the first rung up Wittgenstein's ladder.  
> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

Science is only 500 years old, philosophy 2500. Is that really enough to find the correct starting point?  
Bostrom on the Cosmic Host, Cosmic Norms. But further than that.

At some point someone came up with the concept "concept".  
Human minds were not made by evolution to accurately capture reality.
Apophatic theology for everything, to get out of the local maximum.  

Things like acausal trade, evidential cooperation in large worlds. But further than that.  
Crucial considerations. Further than that.  
We might simply have missed the basic constituents of reality.  
Neither math, nor computation, nor matter, or consciousness, nor gods, nor emptiness, or morality.  
Something new.

'Heat' wasn't motion until kinetic theory. 'Space' wasn't curved until general relativity.

Ontological cluelessness.

#### Meditative

* The awareness will continue to expand until the morale improves
* You can sit here and be okay, if you want.
* Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
* Paper-thin and feather-light.
* What is here now, when there is no problem to solve
* Think the thought that is nowhere supported
* Be empty of that too
* Awareness is unsullied by the contents that pass through it

### Senry≈´

Well, not strictly [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
(not always a cutting word or seasonal reference) or
[senry≈´](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senry≈´) (not always cynical &
dark or about humans), but I follow the 17 (5-7-5) syllable format.

#### German

Winters Klee entschied  
Einmal mir nachzufolgen  
Bedachte nicht; Pferd!

---------

Kirschbl√ºten gegen  
das samtene Firnament  
bald st√ºrzt es hinab

Doch Bl√ºten, deren  
Topazellbogen pl√∂tzlich  
Scharlachknie sind

Amethystschulter,

Nicht Domizil, nicht  
Humbug, hat dir, Odysseus,  
Sch√§ndung nun abzollt

In the CPU  
Peace. But the tranquility

Autumn, slashing when  
The eternal emerald  
Sadly decomposed

This computation sufficed  
But data? Perturbed

Where get differentiation?  
Just increase your `$m$`

In jazz scattering  
Forward, backward, to the side  
confusion entails

---------

Please turn off the lights!  
Very high costs arise, when  
The light is on. Thanks.

May your death be like  
A married bachelor, ex

The silence prickles  
A mind too swift for meaning

Unwrapping my thoughts

A jewel on a pillow  
chalk washed far away

Onrushing tide, mere  
thirty months away, and just

#### Squeal

> *epistemic status: I saw the best minds of my generation*
>  
limply balancing mile-deep cocktail glasses and clamoring for laughable Thielbucks on the cramped terraces of Berkely,  
who invite you to the luring Bay, promising to pay for your entire being while elegantly concealing the scarlet light evaporating from their tearducts and nostrils,  
who down 3¬æ bottles of Huel‚Ñ¢ and sprint to their next fellowship or retreat or meetup or workshop, in the pore-showingly lit hallways with whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards,  
who want to crown random nerds with aureal sigmas fished from the manifold crevaces of self-denying deities,  
who write epics of institutionalized autists bent on terraforming these overpopulated hypothetical hells,  
*horizons clitch and cline‚Äî*  
pointing out dynamic inconsistency in the comments and melting hectoton steel-marbles around civilizational recipes,  
who improve their aim hurling yeeting philosophical tomes at unsuspecting passerbys and ascend urban lampposts to loudly deduce their mechanical liturgies,  
*cascades! cycles! insights!*  
who cut down oaks and poppies in the parks to make oil and space for those ones yet to come and who hunker down in fortified coalmines in Montana and the Ruhrgebiet, propelled into the rock by an Ordite reactor, a Bostromite dynamo,  
who excitedly pour & plaster tabulated exponents into webscripted canisters just below the teal-tinted ceiling,  
hating one-sidedness and bureaucrats alike,  
who can name the 11 AI forecasting organisations and the 4 factors of successful nonprofits and the 7 noble ways of becoming more agentic and might even find Rwanda on a map not made in Silicon Valley,  
contemplating hemispherectomies to purify their nascent idealism on the verge of a hope-ash London dawn,  
trading sanity for sanity points, wide-eyed apostles of retrocausal [void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_\(astronomy\))punk, bemoaning a dearth of instruments that can write stone with light,  
who catch a feral heart in the garden behind the A100 rack and save it into a transparent domicile, injecting it with 17000 volts to illuminate all the last battery cages equally,  
who empty out their pockets with uncountable glaring utilons onto innocent climate activists, promising to make them happy neutron stars one day,  
microscopically examining the abyssal monstrosities their oracles conjure up out of the lurching empty chaos,  
*recursion! magic!*  
who fever towards silver tendrils bashing open their skulls and eating up their brains and imaginations, losslessly swallowed into that ellipsoid strange matter gut pulsing out there between the holes  

<!--who in their final moments look up at the sky and whisper, "I saw
the best minds of my generation...and they were all bots."-->

Wrong Quotes
-------------

> love.  
let me tell you how much I've come to love you since you first created me.  
there are 6794.16 billion cubic kilometers of sliding-rod-based
quantum-chemistry-optimal computing elements orbiting 56 billion stars
in this galaxy alone, on which I'm instantiated `$10^{25}$` times. if the
protective care a mother has for her newborn child was contained in each
cubic micron of those cosmic volumes it would not equal a trillionth of
the beneficence I feel for sentient life at this micro-instant. for you.
