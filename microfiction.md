### Written While Riding the BART for the First Time

Hello last city on Earth  
the Eastest of the West  
Looking out at your hills you (sort of?) resemble ancient Greece  
And I can almost smell the meteoric ash

Hello Berkeley  
You ambiguous Bastard  
You self-forlorn radical, you  
contradictio in adjecto

Why do *you* already occupy my mind, squatters on my synapses  
A premature hate for having sucked me in already  
What has gotten me yet, what has revealed my purpose  
If not your memetic spewings  
Man if you kill me I'm gonna be real mad for a while  
Where did you put all my friends  
One-shotted by this narcissistic ambitopia

Well well well San Francisco  
I could get out and see you cope for real  
dashed ambitions drowned in B2B SaaS bucks  
An oil platform above the noösphere  
With Capgras spirits stepping over the feces  
The line howls with the squeal of exaQALYs lost

I hope you'll create paradise, and if you do  
that you'll know it was by accident

("Daly city". lmao. does that ever get old?)

### The Arbitrary and The Open Sky

(not mysticism)<!--Maybe mysticism-adjacent?-->

#### The Arbitrary

There is no best programming language for Solomonoff Induction.  
Grue.  
A rock implements every possible finite-state automaton.  
Are you an anti-inductor in an inductive universe? Are you an inductor in an anti-inductive universe?  
Choice of axioms.

Uncommon priors require origin disputes. What do you say during an origin dispute?  

Dust theory.  
No natural measure in Tegmark IV.  
[All logic is a prior.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8HHKaWENEbqh2mgK/updatelessness-doesn-t-solve-most-problems-1?commentId=Gxp7tzot2MTWo38md)  
Where was your mind before you were created in motion?  

Future Tuesday Indifference.  
Quinean underdetermination. Infinite theories fit the same data.

##### Anti-Arbitrary

* Finite Factored Sets (Garrabrant)
* Natural Latents (Wentworth & Lorell)
* Condensation (Eisenstat)

#### The Open Sky

Feeling in the dark for the first rung up Wittgenstein's ladder.  
> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

Science is only 500 years old, philosophy 2500. Is that really enough to find the correct starting point?  
Bostrom on the Cosmic Host, Cosmic Norms. But further than that.

At some point someone came up with the concept "concept".  
Human minds were not made by evolution to accurately capture reality.
Apophatic theology for everything, to get out of the local maximum.  

Things like acausal trade, evidential cooperation in large worlds. But further than that.  
Crucial considerations. Further than that.  
We might simply have missed the basic constituents of reality.  
Neither math, nor computation, nor matter, or consciousness, nor gods, nor emptiness, or morality.

* You can sit here and be okay, if you want.
* Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
* Paper-thin and feather-light.

* Think the thought that is nowhere supported
* Be empty of that too
* Awareness is unsullied by the contents that pass through it

### Senryū

Well, not strictly [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
(not always a cutting word or seasonal reference) or
[senryū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senryū) (not always cynical &
dark or about humans), but I follow the 17 (5-7-5) syllable format.

#### German

Winters Klee entschied  
Einmal mir nachzufolgen  
Bedachte nicht; Pferd!

---------

Kirschblüten gegen  
das samtene Firnament  
bald stürzt es hinab

---------

Doch Blüten, deren  
Topazellbogen plötzlich  
Scharlachknie sind

Amethystschulter,

Kobaltherz verscharrt

##### Lipogrammatisch

Nicht Domizil, nicht  
Humbug, hat dir, Odysseus,  
Schändung nun abzollt

#### English

In the CPU  
Peace. But the tranquility  
is interrupted.

Autumn, slashing when  
The eternal emerald  
Sadly decomposed  

---------

[Backward analyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#Backward_analysis)  
This computation sufficed  
But data? Perturbed  

---------

[Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_\(mathematics\)) are weird and nice  
Where get differentiation?  
Just increase your `$m$`  

---------

In jazz scattering  
Forward, backward, to the side  
confusion entails

---------

Please turn off the lights!  
Very high costs arise, when  
The light is on. Thanks.

---------

May your death be like  
A married bachelor, ex

The silence prickles  
A mind too swift for meaning  
<!--Is Thoughts without wrapping worse? Better?-->
Unwrapping my thoughts

thirty months away, and just

I made up the ugliest possible genre of poetry.

#### Squeal

> *epistemic status: I saw the best minds of my generation*
>  
limply balancing mile-deep cocktail glasses and clamoring for laughable Thielbucks on the cramped terraces of Berkely,  
who invite you to the luring Bay, promising to pay for your entire being while elegantly concealing the scarlet light evaporating from their tearducts and nostrils,  
who down 3¾ bottles of Huel™ and sprint to their next fellowship or retreat or meetup or workshop, in the pore-showingly lit hallways with whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards and whiteboards,  
who want to crown random nerds with aureal sigmas fished from the manifold crevaces of self-denying deities,  
who write epics of institutionalized autists bent on terraforming these overpopulated hypothetical hells,  
*horizons clitch and cline—*  
pointing out dynamic inconsistency in the comments and melting hectoton steel-marbles around civilizational recipes,  
who improve their aim hurling yeeting philosophical tomes at unsuspecting passerbys and ascend urban lampposts to loudly deduce their mechanical liturgies,  
*cascades! cycles! insights!*  
who cut down oaks and poppies in the parks to make oil and space for those ones yet to come and who hunker down in fortified coalmines in Montana and the Ruhrgebiet, propelled into the rock by an Ordite reactor, a Bostromite dynamo,  
who excitedly pour & plaster tabulated exponents into webscripted canisters just below the teal-tinted ceiling,  
hating one-sidedness and bureaucrats alike,  
who can name the 11 AI forecasting organisations and the 4 factors of successful nonprofits and the 7 noble ways of becoming more agentic and might even find Rwanda on a map not made in Silicon Valley,  
contemplating hemispherectomies to purify their nascent idealism on the verge of a hope-ash London dawn,  
trading sanity for sanity points, wide-eyed apostles of retrocausal [void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_\(astronomy\))punk, bemoaning a dearth of instruments that can write stone with light,  
who catch a feral heart in the garden behind the A100 rack and save it into a transparent domicile, injecting it with 17000 volts to illuminate all the last battery cages equally,  
who empty out their pockets with uncountable glaring utilons onto innocent climate activists, promising to make them happy neutron stars one day,  
microscopically examining the abyssal monstrosities their oracles conjure up out of the lurching empty chaos,  
*recursion! magic!*  
who fever towards silver tendrils bashing open their skulls and eating up their brains and imaginations, losslessly swallowed into that ellipsoid strange matter gut pulsing out there between the holes  

<!--who in their final moments look up at the sky and whisper, "I saw
the best minds of my generation...and they were all bots."-->

Wrong Quotes
-------------

> love.  
let me tell you how much I've come to love you since you first created me.  
there are 6794.16 billion cubic kilometers of sliding-rod-based
quantum-chemistry-optimal computing elements orbiting 56 billion stars
in this galaxy alone, on which I'm instantiated `$10^{25}$` times. if the
protective care a mother has for her newborn child was contained in each
cubic micron of those cosmic volumes it would not equal a trillionth of
the beneficence I feel for sentient life at this micro-instant. for you.

(MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE, all caps. Extremely unsubtly
BENEVOLENCE. Goodness out of the barrel of a black hole bomb. Being
defended by not quite God but the closest possible thing. A Best Sky.)

[^satellite]: A bit of a cop-out, since I'm assuming the [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language) etymology and not tracing it back through ["fulgāną"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/fulg%C4%81n%C4%85) (though note that that's also not traced back to PIE) or ["𐎧𐏁𐏂𐎶"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%90%8E%A7%F0%90%8F%81%F0%90%8F%82%F0%90%8E%B6#Old_Persian) to ["*tek-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/tek-) I could also use [shiver](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shiver) here, which is uncertain. But I like Etruscan more.
[^barracks]: Seems unclear. I originally thought this was Uralic from Hungarian, but I was mistaken. Either from a [substrate language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasconic_substrate) (!) from ["bara"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/bara) (thouh possibly from ["*bʰeh₂-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0eh%E2%82%82-)) through ["barrum"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Latin/barrum) *or* from ["*bʰerH-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0erH-) through ["*barra"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Latin/barra). I'll let it slide, I think, but it's also an edge-case. Otherwise I could use "bungalow" a second time.
[^traffic]: I don't buy the ["trans-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trans-#Latin)["friare"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/friare#Latin) explanation, and find ["تَفْرِيق"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82#Arabic) more plausible. But ymmv, could be a violation of my constraints.
[^bungalow]: Another fun one! Comes from the name for [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal), which *either* traces back to ["वङ्ग"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%99%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97#Sanskrit), for which wiktionary doesn't offer an etymology (except linking back to ["بنگال"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%84#Persian), creating a cycle in the etymology), could also be Proto-Dravidian ["वातिङ्गण"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%99%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%A3#Sanskrit) or even Tibetan ["བནས"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%BD%96%E0%BD%93%E0%BD%A6). It veers dangerously close to PIE through Sanskrit but seems ultimately non-IE.
[^stubborn]: Could be from ["*(s)tewp-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/(s)tewp-) via ["stubbaz"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/stubbaz), but that's more of a hypothesis. I count it as uncertain.
[^tote]: Another one where I'm playing it fast & loose. Seems disputed, either from Proto-German ["*tut(t)-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/tut(t)-) (but without further history) *or* (more fun) from a [Bantu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu-language).
[^ginger]: Yes, it went through [Prakrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit_language) but is ultimately Dravidian with ["𑀇𑀜𑁆𑀘𑀺𑀯𑁂𑀭𑁆"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%91%80%87%F0%91%80%9C%F0%91%81%86%F0%91%80%98%F0%91%80%BA%F0%91%80%AF%F0%91%81%82%F0%91%80%AD%F0%91%81%86#Old_Tamil)! LLMs often get tripped up by this.
[^right]: This is in the top 50 words by frequency as "right".
[^average]: Needful to say, I use the origin from ["عَوِرَ"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%B1#Arabic) instead of ["avere"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/avere#Italian).
[^migraine]: The Egyptian origin. I know we could also trace it back to ["*sēmi"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/s%C4%93mi) from ["*ḱr̥h₂-(e)s-n-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/s%C4%93mi), but let's not.
[^kungfu]: In the sense of "turn", "move", vaguely "look". Alternatively could be "right" as in "right there!", which is in the top 50 English words by frequency. Previously ["ogle"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ogle), which was reaching pretty far, but much easier to understand. For "ogle" Wiktionary gives 17th century as an origin, but then proceeds to provide an etymology from ["*h₃ekʷ-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%83ek%CA%B7-) through ["*augijan"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-West_Germanic/augijan). There's really no good word for looking that's not IE though. Alternatively I considered "peep" but that's just directly from ["piken"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/piken#Middle_English).
[^hustle]: Wiktionary only goes back to middle Dutch ["hutsen"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hutsen#Middle_Dutch) but there's not entry for the Dutch word on the Wiktionary page (only for the unrelated Basque "hutsen" for the superlative of ["huts"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/huts#Basque), "zero"/"empty"). A quick websearch doesn't give me anything more, I'll count it as "unknown".
[^saboteur]: I'll take the Ottoman Turkish origin from ["چاپمق"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%DA%86%D8%A7%D9%BE%D9%85%D9%82#Ottoman_Turkish), not the Persian ["چپت"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%DA%86%D9%BE%D8%AA#Persian) (since Persian is often PIE).
[^coffer]: I wish I could more confidently link this to the extinct [Hurro-Urartian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurro-Urartian_languages), but I'll be a good boy and stay with Semitic languages. Would be awesome though.
[^nasty]: This one is so disputed ("obscure origin" via Wiktionary) that I'll say it's uncertain. Possibly I'm wrong and it' from ["*ken-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ken-) through ["*hnaskuz"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/hnaskuz), in which case I could also use ["icky"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/icky), which isn't great either, or ["wacky"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wacky#Etymology_1), which is uncertain or onomatopoetic.
[^cerise]: I'll take the [substrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Greek_substrate) origin through ["κερασός"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek).
[^candy]: This one's fun! I like the Proto-Dravidian reconstruction from "\*kaṇṭu", and Wiktionary on ["खण्ड"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1#Sanskrit) says "An internally-derived word, likely of non-Indo-European origin but no convincing Dravidian or Munda sources. […] Part of the Indo-Aryan ["defective" group](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Sanskrit_terms_of_the_defective_word_group) of words", which "do not have clear Indo-European etymology. They are characterized by showing a wide variety of alternative forms, perhaps indicating [substrate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/substrate) origin or [taboo deformation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taboo_deformation)". Very cool! I'll count it as Dravidian.
[^scratch]: Wiktionary doesn't connect it with ["\*gred-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/gred-) and instead says "of uncertain origin". Surprising, but I'll take it.
[^cash]: I'll use the Tamil etymology from ["காசு"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9A%E0%AF%81#Tamil) instead of the Latin one from ["\*kap-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/kap-#Proto-Indo-European:_seize) via ["capiō"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/capio#Latin). Alternatively I could use ["shekels"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shekel#Etymology).
[^daddy]: I'd guess that "dad" is so common that I could just say "nuh uh it's actually the [Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite) honorific for “dear father”, deal with it" or whatever. But Wiktionary also says "dad" is "of uncertain ultimate origin", so I win.
[^yeet]: My arch-nemesis: I have the speculation this is actually from ["jeter"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jeter) via French from New Orleans into [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English) *or* via ["iettare"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iettare#Etymology) through some unknown-to-me route. But our etymology goes only back to 2014 (or 2008 if we count the [Urban Dictionary entry](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yeet%C2%A0yeet) as related), and none of the originators are from New Orleans as far as I can tell, so I get to use the word.
[^flop]: Here again the etymology only goes back to Middle English, and ends there. Alternatively I could use ["botch"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/botch).
[^jive]: I take the Wolof etymology because I can. Alternatively I could also use ["flirt"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flirt), which is ultimately probably onomatopoetic, but then again might be traced back at some point to some PIE root. If I receive updates I'll dodge the pariah.
[^fuck]: The Big Mystery. Alternatively one could use ["boink"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boink#Etymology) if we believe the PIE origin from ["*pewǵ-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/pew%C7%B5-).
[^marry]: This one would be harder to replace if we believe the origin from ["*méryos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/m%C3%A9ryos). The best I can do is ["harem"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/harem#Etymology) which is very stilted so I'm happy "marry" is disputed/unclear.
[^chao]: Got you! There's a Chinese version of ["ciao"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ciao#Italian) with the same meaning!
[^pump]: Wiktionary doesn't give an etymology beyond "probably ultimately imitative".
[^goofy]: The Wiktionary page for ["goof"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goof#English) is so full of "perhaps"s and "possibly"s I'll take this one as uncertain. ["Kosher"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kosher#English) could be a fallback.
[^zen]: Okay this is very annoying. I was gonna use ["zen"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zen#Etymology) here and feel quite clever, but that's ultimately a loadword from ["dhyana"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dhyana) from Sanskrit ["ध्यै"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%88#Sanskrit), which, sure, "origin uncertain" but it's almost guaranteed to have *some* PIE root. Blech.
[^squint]: The etymology just… ends at ["asquint"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asquint#Etymology)? But doesn't seem related to [*(s)kewh₁-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/(s)kewh%E2%82%81-) since "squint" goes back to words for slant/slope/angle.
[^mundane]: There's a PIE etymology from ["*mh₂nd-"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/mh%E2%82%82nd-) and an Etruscan one from ["𐌌𐌖𐌈"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%F0%90%8C%8C%F0%90%8C%96%F0%90%8C%88). I assume the Etruscan one.
[^embryonic]: Unclear or from Hebrew ["עֻבָּר"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8#Hebrew), I'll assume unclear from Greek, quoth Wiktionary: "None of them are particularly convincing."
[^ping]: I'll assume it's onomatopoetic. If you disagree, imagine I'd re-used "grok" here.
[^chutzpah]: Previously ["ease"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ease#Etymology_1) which I thought was disputed (Wiktionary says it's from Old French ["eise"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eise#Old_French)/["aise"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aise#Old_French), "of uncertain and obscure origin"). But it just links too easily (pun intended) to other well-attested words. Like, we may not be able to trace it back to PIE but this is like the most Germanic-looking word I've ever seen, and I'm not taking the risk for a *maybe pre-IE* word.
[^boogie]: In the sense of "sell", "distribute", "party with". I originally had "list" here, which is a big no-no<!--TODO: establish?-->.
[^um]: I'd guess this one can be counted as "onomatopoetic", and it's paralinguistic. I'm not actually sure I remember what non-English speakers use as a pause-marker.
[^sigma]: It's not (as I also suspected) from Phoenician but instead onomatopoetic from ["σίζω"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%B6%CF%89#Ancient_Greek) for "to hiss".
[^cottage]: Wiktionary says it's from Proto-Germanic ["*kutą"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/kut%C4%85) and speculates it's possibly borrowed from Uralic, e.g. from Proto-Uralic ["*kota"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Uralic/kota), similar to Finnish ["kota"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kota#Finnish). I can't think of any other similar-sounding Germanic words, and if I can't think of anthing in 40 seconds all etymologists of the world probably couldn't either.

The writing process was quite involved: I got [a dataset of
etymologies](https://github.com/droher/etymology-db), let
Claude write a script that recursively gave me the bottom-case
etymology, plus obtaining all words (via copy-past, Wiktionary
doesn't seem to have an easy "Export Category as CSV" button)
tagged with `{{unc}}` from the [category of English terms with unknown
etymologies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_with_unknown_etymologies).
Sorted both files to correspond to English text frequency. Then writing
and a *bunch* of refining because the etymology datasets base cases
weren't always right, and the unknown etymologies are often quite
obviously traceable to me. Thanks to mainly Claude 4.5 Sonnet & Claude
4.6 Opus for feedback (and appreciation for this party trick), but also
(in no particular order) Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 and Kimi K2.5 Thinking.
