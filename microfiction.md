### Senry≈´

Well, not strictly [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
(not always a cutting word or seasonal reference) or
[senry≈´](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senry≈´) (not always cynical &
dark or about humans), but I follow the 17 (5-7-5) syllable format.

#### German

Winters Klee entschied  
Einmal mir nachzufolgen  
Bedachte nicht; Pferd!

Kirschbl√ºten gegen  
das samtene Firnament  
bald st√ºrzt es hinab

#### English

In the CPU  
Peace. But the tranquility  
is interrupted.

Autumn, slashing when  
The eternal emerald  
Sadly decomposed  

[Backward analyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#Backward_analysis)  
This computation sufficed  
But data? Perturbed  

[Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_\(mathematics\)) are weird and nice  
Where get differentiation?  
Just increase your `$m$`  

In jazz scattering  
Forward, backward, to the side  
confusion entails

Please turn off the lights!  
Very high costs arise, when  
The light is on. Thanks.

May your death be like  
A married bachelor, ex  
falso quodlibet

The silence prickles  
A mind too fast for meaning  
<!--Is Thoughts without wrapping worse? Better?-->
Unwrapping my thoughts

<!--
Some minds start cutting  
themselves, if the do not dull  
themselves in a while

A psyche might start  
cutting itself, if it is  
not dulled each fortnight
-->

A sharp mind might start  
cutting itself, if it ain't  
dulled once in a while

Stories
--------

> Law of conservation of valence.

----

> Globe-decorated neo-neoliberals furiously fruitlessly arguing with
zero-summers on twitter, shaman bros helping others get laid at parties
funded by eternal-life cryptomoguls, infra-red haired identity-fractalites
with two dozen Mercedes stars draped over their bodies lectureing pale
soy-skeletons about Cockshottian cybernetics. It is, not exaggerating too
much, a moment exactly fitting the emergence of a second semi-unknown
unknown, only to be faintly perceived by posterior-maximizers who have
trained their sensory organs to the maximal degree of data intake possible
without (at the moment outside of military circles unavailable) BCIs. And
yet, the 'works scale and scale, just as foretold by the ùîä prophet.
