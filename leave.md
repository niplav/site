> __The optimization power of attention-grabbing systems available over
the internet is growing faster than any normal human's ability to defend
against such attention grabbing, and seems likely to continue to grow. If
one values ones own time, it therefore seems worthwhile to limit ones
access to the internet, more so than people usually do.__

Many people have noticed that they are using the internet and online
services (e.g. through apps) more than they would ideally like, in a
non-optimal manner, with effects on work productivity, reducing selective
sustained attention spans, and with a large opportunity cost.

The Basic Argument
------------------

The basic argument can be summarized as follows: There is an economic
incentive to get people addicted to things. Currently, information
technology appears to be the fastest advancing sector of the economy,
and is therefore the most potent way of getting people addicted.

If one wants to avoid falling into addictive patterns, then, it seems
advisable to be very cautious around information technology, and in
the more paranoid case, one wants to stay out of the addictive "event
horizon": the state at which it has become basically impossible to
unplug—which means that one ought to prepare to leave the internet.

### Two Different Growth Modes

The world economy is currently growing at [~3% a
year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product),
which implies that during the [average
lifetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy)
of a human, it grows `$1.03^{70} \approx 9$`-fold (and
that is before considering possible [changes in the growth
mode](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory "Modeling the Human Trajectory (David Roodman, 2020)")
from exponential to [hyperbolic
growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_growth)).

While human minds are extraordinarily adaptive (surviving as
hunter-gatherers, farmers, industrial workers, scientists,
in space, etc.), they appear to have some hard-coded
characteristics that are not easily changed during a
human's lifetime (or even by evolution—[counterexamples
include](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_human_evolution)
the evolution of [lactase
persistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/Lactase_persistence), [alcohol
dehydrogenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/Alcohol_dehydrogenase) and
[sickle cell anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/Sickle_cell_disease)).
Humanities' ability to create technology outstrips each
individual's ability to understand that technology—the [Commodore
64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) is said to be the
last computer that can be fully understood by one person in its
totality, and AI systems are becoming so complex that [explainable
AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)
and interpretability research are becoming their own fields.

While economic growth has been on the whole a [delightfully advantageous
process](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/),
this makes individual humans more prone to manipulation, deception,
and addiction to these kinds of processes.

### Humans Minds are Full of Holes

This would be no problem if human brains were
the [OpenBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/OpenBSD) or
[seL4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family) of
cognitive systems, but alas—we were created by evolution as [spaghetti
towers](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers),
and until we [change something about
that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroenhancement), our minds will
remain unstructured heaps of pasta.

Not only do we bring up an impressive barrage of [cognitive
biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases),
but it seems likely that our brains are
designed to [deceive and hide information from
themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_in_the_Brain)<!--TODO:
perhaps replace with a GoodReads link-->.
And knowing about cognitive biases and flawed thinking usually helps
little with actually mitigating them, sometimes even [amplifying the
problem](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people).

> Coherent, comprehensive theories of cognitive bias mitigation are lacking.

*— [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia), [“Cognitive Bias Mitigation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Bias_Mitigation), 2021*

This applies even more strongly to addictive tendencies and emotional
outbursts.

At the moment, technology is just
moving more quickly than evolution or [cultural
evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_evolution) (which is why
the tricks of [pickup artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/Pickup_artist)
continue to work: the defenses against them operate on the timescales
of cultural or genetic evolution, and the pickup artists also usually
put in more optimization work than the women they approach).<!--Maybe
this is causing the selection criteria back to hard-to-fake signals,
from social status/charisma back to height/wealth? Although it doesn't
look like it.-->

Similarly, companies usually put in much more effort to manipulate their
customers than the customers put into defending against that manipulation.

### An Incentive for Addiction

Producers of a good have an incentive to modify their (potential)
customers' preferences so that those customers want to consume
more of their product. Examples for this are not hard to
find, with perhaps the most striking one being the [opioid
epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/Opioid_epidemic),
especially [in the United
States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States),
but other examples include
[gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling),
[nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine), gustatorily appealing
fast food, and the complete practice of advertising.

As long as companies can legally get away with it, they have an incentive
to modify the preferences of their (potential) customers as to desire more
of the product of that company.

### Regulators are Slow

> He's the guy who patented using genetic algorithms to patent everything
they can permutate from an initial description of a problem domain
– not just a better mousetrap, but the set of all possible better
mousetraps. Roughly a third of his inventions are legal, a third are
illegal, and the remainder are legal but will become illegal as soon as
the legislatosaurus wakes up, smells the coffee, and panics.

*— [Charles Stross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross), [“Accelerando”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando) p. 11, 2005*

Existing legislative bodies move too slowly and don't understand
the problem well enough to do much about it, and often the resulting
polarization & outrage is in their interest.

<!--TODO: continue-->

### Addiction to Information is More Dangerous

Why, then, focus on addiction to information specifically? If the whole
economy is growing faster than any human can defend, and companies have
an incentive to get me addicted, shouldn't I worry about *everything*,
and retreat into a bunker while the world around me falls into a spiral
of self-reinforcing behavioral loops?

Well, yes, [maybe](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/index-old.shtml "Disaster planning for regular folks (lcamtuf 2021)")!
But, barring complete independence from the rest of society, there are
reasons to focus on addictive information systems in particular.

#### Information Moves Freely and Quickly

The current setup of the internet (at least in [western
countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_firewall)) allows most
types of information exchange to occur freely, without obstruction, and
nearly instantaneously from any part of the planet to any other. The same
can not be said for physical objects, making both regulation easier and
feedback loops slower. Thus, if the provider of an addictive service
is regulated in a country, it can often change servers and appear on
the web again in a short time (as shown by the difficulty of shutting
down [The Pirate Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay),
[sci-hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sci-hub), or [Library
Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_genesis) (this
method is not entirely foolproof, as shown by the [censorship of
TikTok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_tiktok), especially
in India)).

#### Information is Not on the Radar of Legislators (For Now)

While there is much ado about
[privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy),
for example the [right to be
forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)
or the [General Data Protection
Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation),
[humane technology]()<!--TODO: link, but there isn't a wikipedia article
about this yet--> isn't very much on the radar of legislators yet—a
[summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media_usage_and_mental_health#Industry_and_government)
on Wikipedia lists only some minor actions
by east-Asian countries (again [of their western
counterparts](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society))
and some attempts of large technology companies at self-regulation.

Consequences
-------------

So, dear reader, you might ask what I now want from you. I'm glad you
asked! (Or at least my model of you very conveniently did so).

If you are reading this, it's likely you have already taken *some*
measures to prevent you from wasting too much time on the internet or
internet-connected services. If you haven't, you reading this text this
far is evidence that you should.

My advice is in its strongest form quite drastic: Leave the internet
and everyone connected to it behind, acquire a library (be it physical
or digital) and live in a secluded hut by a remote lake, lest you spend
the rest of your life glued in front of a screen [fuming
at](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/ "The Toxoplasma Of Rage (Scott Alexander, 2014)")
[how other peoples' opinions can be so
wrong](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/ "Sort By Controversial (Scott Alexander, 2018)"),
or just mindlessly scrolling while the hours (and days, and weeks…)
trickle by…

### I am Lightyears Ahead of You

People are going to make their restrictions around blockers/grayscreening
etc. stricter and stricter.

### Giving Up Much

### The Providers Will Act

### You Are Missing a Mood About the Greatness of the Internet

### Similar Arguments Were Made

What is To Be Done?
-------------------

### Make Phasing Out Possible

### Lag Behind 5 Years

How?
----

### Download Stuff

As an example, here's the things I have downloaded for offline reading:

* Remaining episodes of the [podcasts I listen to](./podcasts_list.html)
* All music I want to listen to
* A large collection (several thousands) of books and papers I want to read
* [Websites I like](./sites.html)

To download a website, I usually used the command wget<!--TODO: link-->:

	wget --page-requisites -e robots=off -p -k -c -r --mirror -p --html-extension -R '*replytocom*,*like_comment*,*p=*,*test-preview=*,*test-expand=*,*url=*,*share=*,*commentId=*,*sortedBy=*,*after=*,*before=*,*limit=*,*filter=*,*showPostCount=*,*useTagName=*,*///*,*social-media/*,*updated-max=*,*max-results=*,*reverse-paginate=*,*showComment=*,*filters_and=*,*following%5C*,*https:%5C*,*fsnapshot*' -P . www.example.com

This excludes downloading the same page for every comment with wordpress
sites, and different versions of the allPosts pages for the EA forum and
LessWrong. Unfortunately, both the EA forum and LessWrong are not very
amenable to being downloaded this way, and I will have to experiment
with other approaches. It also sadly can't distinguish between resources
(like images) hosted on other sites and other websites, and so those are
missing (if `-H` is turned on, it begins downloading the entire internet).

To download a webpage, I use this command:

	wget -H -e robots=off -p -k www.example.com/resource.html

### Have a Designated “Internet Location” Which is Not At Home

Optionally: Separate work with internet, work without internet, fun with
internet, fun without internet spaces

Retrospective
--------------

Started 2021-05-21.

I definitely have (had?) a problem with wasting
time on the internet, barely consciously scrolling
reddit/twitter/lesswrong/4chan/…. Mercifully, I don't have exact
numbers, but I would estimate that since I started using the internet
~10 years ago, I have spent ≥~1½h a day on it unproductively, giving
me at least `$10*365*1.5h=5475h$` hours wasted. Had I poured half of
that into honing a new skill, or acquiring a new one… But what is
important is to avoid wasting another 5000h, instead of crying about
the ones that had already fallen into a screen.

AI Disaster Scenario: Human Progress Stalls Due To Attention-Destroyers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

AI systems become capable enough to sap out most of human
attention/ability to work, this prevents more capable AI systems from
being built, but also destroys any options for progress.

This might end up in an equilibrium.
