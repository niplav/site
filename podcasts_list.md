Side-note: Why would anyone want to name their podcast "The X Podcast
with Gleeroy Finkelberg", if not for self-aggrandisement? Shouldn't
the name of the podcast be sufficient to be a brand in
itself? Or is it that many people really build a [parasocial
relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction)
with the podcast host, and the naming encourages that?
