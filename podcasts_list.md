Whining
--------

Side-note: Why would anyone want to name their podcast "The X Podcast
with Gleeroy Finkelberg", if not for self-aggrandisement? Shouldn't
the name of the podcast be sufficient to be a brand in
itself? Or is it that many people really build a [parasocial
relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction)
with the podcast host, and the naming encourages that?

Also frustrating: inconsistent (or missing) numbering of podcast episodes
([Zero Squared](https://dietsoap.podomatic.com/), starting off as a
separate podcast called "Diet Soap", being an especially egregious
example of this: early episodes missing from the feed (?), switching
numbering schemes multiple times, unnumbered special (and mundane)
episodes, splitting into (and merging back) multiple podcasts such as
"Pop the Left" or "Symptomatic Redness" or "Alternatives Podcast" or
"Inside Zero Books" or "The History of the American Left", all on the
same feed (arrghhh!), changing the Patreon subscribers model multiple
times (e.g. releasing only previews of every second episode for a while,
then creating a special podcast for patreons only), releasing "Zero
Books Special" episodes, calling itself at times "Zero Books Podcast" or
"Zero Squared" or "Zero Podcast" (okay, fine, `$0^2=0$`, but still…),
and finally renaming itself back to "Diet Soap" after over 10 years!).

So if I say I have listened to all publically available episodes of Zero
Squared, that is a very qualified statement (if someone has episodes
1–3, 5, 7–8, 10–11, 13–24, 26, 32–33, 36–40, 42–43, 51–53,
183, 185, 187, 189–190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200, 203, 205, 208, 210,
212, 215, 223, 228–229, 258, I'd be happy to pay half a dollar per
episode, just to silence my inner completionist).
