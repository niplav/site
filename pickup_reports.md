Approaches
----------

### 2022-03-12

#### Schizo Woman

I approached her during a Saturday daygame session with a wing. Probably
in her late twenties, dressed kind of weirdly (dark grayish green coat
and pants). When I started talking to her, I started stacking about her
outfit, and suggested that she was probably off to mountaineering.

She took the hook perfectly, and I was already internally fist-pumping,
but then she started talking non-stop about her hiking trip to a holy
mountain in Tibet, and how 10 people had died there when ascending the
mountain against the better advice of the locals. I've never had any
experience like this in set: she went on rambling for probably 3 minutes
(those of you who have done daygame approaches know that this is super
uncommon, and only happens if either the women is super into you or
crazy—possibly both).

When I got talking again, she compulsively opened and closed her jacket
probably five times, bending her body weirdly to do so (I am pretty sure
it was not intended to be sexy).

I got her number, and went back to my wing to pour my heart out about how
confusing the experience had been (it is hard for me to convey how high
her schizo-energy had been over text, but believe me: it was frightening).

I messaged her a day or two later:

> Me: “Hi […], it was cool meeting you yesterday. Are you always this friendly to strangers 😉?”  
> Her: “Hey”  
> “I am”

Excellent texting from her side.

I left it at that, both considering that she didn't seem like she could
consent to anything, and also fearing for the health of my reproductive
organs in the event that we would meet up.

#### French First Love

I approached her in the same session as the [schizo
woman](./pickup_reports.html#Schizo_Woman), a bit later. She was a
student on an exchange program, and only in the city for a short while.
Quite giggly, and just blazing with feminine energy and playfulness —
one of those women who are maybe a high seven looks wise (not dressed very
stylishly, but she was quite pretty), but who boost their attractiveness
with their personality. She is the only "nine" I have approached
so far (out of ~350 approaches). Most of that attractiveness comes from
her behavior, building on a solid foundation of physical cuteness.

Just…wow. Amazing.

Pseudo-psychoanalyzing myself a bit, I think I was attracted to her so
much because she looked & behaved a bit like the first and only girl
I fell in Love with (as in capital L, the stuff that is comparable to
psychoactive substances in intensity).

I was probably too nerdy in the approach, talking about the French
existentialists, and guessing she studied philosophy. I also exited the
approach too quickly, and asked "Why?" when she said she didn't want
to give me her contact details, but in a non-playful way (something like
"I bet you've never had a [country] […] lover before!" would have
been much better). I was smitten after the approach.

She was on. She was enjoying the approach, or perhaps just the attention.
But she was on.

As [Nash](https://daysofgame.com) always says:

Viva Daygame.

#### What a Strong Shit Test

I'm out on with a wing in a kind of trashy mall not far from where I live
(in an area with low socio-economic status, and high crime). I see a young
woman (maybe 19 or 20 years old?) walking by and get on the escalator,
after half a second of hesitation (I'd not seen her well) I go for it.

I get on the escalator behind her, she doesn't see me. On the top
floor it's usually much less busy, I let her walk a couple meters until
I wheel in front of her and stop her. She has a kind of funky style:
flowing pants and a orange/red jacket with wide shoulders, plus several
nose rings. I open the standard LDM way, and then start stacking:

> Me: […] but what I noticed about you was the jacket, it looks like you've
been rejected as a member from a biker gang.  
> Her (completely seriously): I actually am a member of a biker gang,
I like to stab men.  
> Me: [half a second of actually believing her and getting kind of
spooked, followed by the thought that this is a way of her telling me
to bugger off]  
> Me (stuttering): Huh, okay… then you're not really interested. Have a nice day.  
> Her (smiling): You too! Thanks for the compliment :-)

I went back to my wing and told him what had
occurred, he immediately pick up on the fact that
she was just shit-testing me. My [vibe simply wasn't strong
enough](./notes_on_pickup.html#Instead_of_Recognizing_and_Dismantling_Shit_Tests_You_Could_Just_Vibe_Over_Them)
to handle it (it's been the strongest shit test I've ever gotten **by
far**).

I am seriously impressed by this. Her delivery of the shit test was
masterful, casual yet with conviction, completely improvised given
my opener (I think she might've actually interrupted me, but I'm not
sure). She was just very good at bantering, much better than I am.
Very masculine delivery as well, my (sadly underdeveloped) bisexual side
now kinda wants to get pegged by her.

I have to admit honorable defeat, and was joking to my wing about becoming
her student for bantering.

What might I've said as a response? (Not that I expect to be able to
deflect this kind of test anytime in the near future, and four days
later you're always wittier)

* "Nice, I've always wanted to be deeply penetrated" (Agree & amplify, with a sexual spike, maybe creepy)
* "If you're never getting stabbed the people you hang out with aren't interesting enough" (Umeshism)
* "Finally, a worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!" or "Cool, wanna take this outside?" (Maybe slightly too chody)

For a couple of earlier sessions at the same mall I'd carried a knife with
me because I'd been threatened by a guy with a knife on public transport,
but this time I didn't (but *imagine* her eyes if I'd opened my jacket
and showed her the knife with the words "cool, wanna take this outside?").

What an experience. I am impressed.

### Super Honest Non-SDL

She was the last stop on a 4-hour 13-approach spree (still a big number
for me, working my vibe towards higher numbers of approaches). She was
wearing all black, so I opened her by comparing her to a large black
candle. She stood very close to me, and my vibe was upbeat (if a bit
tired). I quickly found out that she was a tourist, and it was the last
day of her visit, so I would have to try to make it an SDL (which, with
only one lay under my belt, seemed like a titanic endeavour). She seemed
very keen, inviting me to join her at the museum, which I rejected at
first, instead taking her instagram and talking about meeting her later
that day.

Joining up with my wing, and telling him about the set, he strongly
encouraged me to shoot for an SDL, so I messaged her that I'd join her
at the museum (I know that it was needy, but she seemed very on, and I'd
told her I would meet a friend later, and in fact I had a date lined up
later that day with a Mexican girl). I messaged my date and asked her
if she could meet up a bit earlier (a good flake check), sort of hoping
she would flake on me, while I walked toward the museum. Once there,
I tried to find Miss Candle, but she was already inside the museum. I
contemplated buying a ticket, but decided that it would be too needy,
and instead decided to check out the logistics around the area.

Searching for good bars, I received a flake text from the Mexican girl,
causing me to feel an emotion that I had never felt before—an odd
sense between an inner sigh and an inner fist-pump. Bingo. The SDL-attempt
was on. I did two more approaches, found a bar, ordered a beer, and told
Miss Candle where I was.

She joined me half an hour later, asking me where my friend was;
my response being something along the lines of "he's probably
with a girl somewhere". Started off with random chit-chat about
exercise, travel, interest etc. while I amped up the kino. At
some point she looked at me and told me that she was only seeing
me as a friend, to which I replied with the old Ross Jeffries line
"I don't like putting relationships between people into boxes like
that, but I promise that if anything ever happens between us, it
will be comfortable, and we will be willing and ready" [Strauss 2005 p.
52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game:_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists "The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists")
(praise the lineage of players before me handing down their wisdom). She
laughed and we carried on with the conversation.

After a while I bounced her to another bar, where we continued
the conversation and I amped up the kino, laying my arm around her.
I tried to kiss her (thrice), each time she rejected it with a laugh,
and I told her each time I would try again, to which she just giggled
and continued with the conversation. She knew about the questions game,
so we played it, her being doubting my answer of having had 4 girlfriends
and 8 sexual partners in total, believing I was understating the number
(the real number being 2 girlfriends and 1 sexual partner).

I was really enjoying being honest with her about my intentions in a way
I had never been before with a woman—she knew exactly where we stood,
I had exactly communicated to her what I wanted, and that we were engaged
in the playful dance of seduction and resistance. Glorious.

Around 22:00 she wanted to meet up with a friend of hers at a club, and
I was enjoying her company so much that I walked to the club with her,
talking about bisexuality, the beauty of middle-Eastern women, how she
saw sex as something to do for fun, similar to exercise (major green
flag!) and me possibly visiting her in Barcelona. Once at the club, I
decided it was not going to lead anywhere, and when her friend arrived,
I told him I'd been unsuccessful at seducing her, and hopped on public
transport back home.

This encounter held major lessons for me: Escalating is much easier
after a successful session of daygame, and alcohol makes escalating
much easier; being honest about what you want and expressing those
desires is awesome and can earn you major respect (making you seem
much more like a player); and I got a good feel for what verbal
escalation feels like. It felt like I finally got the ticket to the
[antechamber](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antechamber) of the secret
society.

I do not plan on visiting her in Barcelona (she responded positively to a
ping the next day), because I don't like traveling, but even without any
further interaction, this is my current favourite encounter from daygame.

### A Yes Girl With No Direction

Noticing the weird pack of straw (?) she was carrying in her backpack,
I gave myself an internal push and as soon as the light turned green
I ran after her. I told her she reminded me of images of farmers with
hay on their backs, and then told her that that was in contrast with the
light blue coat she was wearing. Her voice was flat, but when I trailed
off and had nothing to say, she hooked nicely and asked me some questions
(I don't remember what we talked about in set). I was unsure whether she
was nervous: she was scratching an open bleeding sore on her upper lip,
which kind of irritated me (but hey, I'm not free from sin in that regard,
and she was cute).

I think she was mildly surprised when I pulled out my notebook instead
of a phone for her to write her contacts down, after which I talked
for a minute or two more and then we parted ways. In retrospective,
I should have taken for an instant date, but it was not on my mind
(I hadn't and still haven't been on an instant date before) and I was
hungry for more approaches, plus I wanted to meet up with my wing. Still,
the opportunity was there and I should have taken it.

After less than a handful of texts from my and her side, with some light
teasing, I asked her out for drinks, which she declined, but immediately
suggested two alternative dates (this girl had clearly read [Mr. V
2020](./doc/game/guide_to_texting_girls_mr_v_2020.pdf "Guide to Texting Girls")).

Before meeting, I did two unsuccessful sets, according to the
lessons about escalation I'd learned from the encounter with [Miss
Candle](#Super_Honest_NonSDL), both of them leading nowhere, but still
priming me to be more assertive.

She turned up punctually, and I first took her to a French-style café
where we chatted for an hour, revealing that she didn't have a clear
direction in life, having finished a masters degree she wasn't interested
in, now before a job, and without any significant hobbies except "taking
baths and watching movies". I then bounced her to the second venue,
a bar near to where we had initially met. On the way I did some light
kino (guiding her with my arm around her waist, touching her shoulder &
hands), and in the bar I chose a seat so that she could only sit next
to me (and not in front of me—crucial for escalation). I amped up
the escalation a bit, touching her a bit more, doing the questions game
routine, talking about past relationships and sexual fantasies, as well
as creating a bubble around us by guessing what the other people around
us were doing.  The beer was leading it along nicely.

At some point in the questions game she asked me how nervous I was
feeling, and I told her (truthfully) that I wasn't feeling very nervous
(saying it was a 1.5/5). On my question whether I appeared nervous to her,
she said yes (which surprised me, because I was genuinely not feeling
very nervous, this being my second date that week—misperception on
her or my part, or simply a shit test?)

I tried not to invest too much by being silent for longer stretches, which
I didn't completely succeed at, but was better at than my previous dates.

I'd already put my arm around her earlier, and in a round of the questions
game asked her whether she wanted to kiss me, the answer being an awkward
pause and a “maybe later”. I of course took this as an excuse to lean
in and kiss her, and she reciprocated (I think she liked the boldness). I
of course made sure to pull back first, and continued chatting away,
with intermediate spiking and make-outs. My first brazen attempt and
success at a kiss close in a public place, yay!

At some point I told her to sit down next to me instead of on her chair,
which she did without any remark or complaint. I think this indicates
that she was in my frame? I don't remember whether this was before or
after I'd already kissed her.

3 hours into the date she asked me whether we could go to my place —
apparently I had done a good enough job at escalation that she had decided
to sleep with me (or she is just very promiscuous). I told her that we
could go after we'd finished our drinks, and used the old Torero line:
That nothing could happen between us before marriage because I was a
good Christian boy, but she could tuck me in. She was genuinely shocked
and unsure whether that was true, but I laughed & amplified enough that
she got the irony.

Because I was stingy and thought she would be okay with public transport,
I decided not to call a taxi, and we took public transport to my place.

We both got a glass of water, and carried on making out. After maybe 5
minutes, I physically picked her up and carried her into my room (her
remarking on it when seeing my dumbbells—I had earlier stressed the
importance of [exercise in my life](./exercise_log.html)). We carried
on making out, and nothing else happened that night.

;-)

Curtain.

Takeaways:

People always says this, but it's different to personally observe:
Yes-girls are out there, and if you approach them & escalate more
smoothly than a [rauk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wik/rauk), they
want to go to your place and do naughty stuff. Having observed this,
and having a dim idea of how to pull off a decent approach and what
the topology of non-bad escalation might look like, I now have a
semi-repeatable process under my belt that can be practiced. Not
quite the [kenshō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenshō) of
daygame (what would that be, an SDL?), but perhaps the [udayabbaya
ñana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassanā-ñāṇa)?

### Pain is a Great Teacher

#### Miss Labubu Gets Away

A cold front has descended but my horniness drives me out onto the
streets again. My wing & me separate and get drawn back to each other
for debriefs, dancing the dance of state-leeching as I bounce into and
out of approaches with little commitment to the bit. It's cold, I don't
like it. I wonder if I should ask my wing to go back to the Christmas
market but the absolute kitsch from the buskers keeps me away, so I
decide to do a last approach near the train station and then call it
a day. (No idea if it'd *actually* been the last approach of the day,
but it was already 19:35 and I was wrought out by the daily session from
the previous weeks—but they always say that).

I pick a tall 60th-percentile elegance chick walking down to the entrance,
wheel in front of her clumsily and start stacking about her white fuzzy
hat (mushroom comparison incoming!) and her sharp grey style (comparing
it to a captain's uniform, just more depressing). She loves it; jackpot.

We flirt a bit more by talking about clothing style, she lets me touch
her necklace and admires mine, we talk about what she was up to and
she shows me the labubu she just bought from a nearby mall. I think it
is going splendidly and thus invite her over to a Starbucks, when she
points out she doesn't like coffee[^same], I change course and head for
a small café selling tea near the station.

We get a tea (I pay), sit down and start talking. She is from Ukraine
(came in early 2022), currently unemployed and ¿lives with her
mother? iirc.

[^same]: Neither do I actually.

Sessions
---------

What's the Qiaochu Yuan tweet?

### So, Last Summer I Took a Medium Dose of MDMA

It worked pretty well, 22 approaches (twice optimal normal rate),
AA pretty much zero, 5 numbers (although only 2 non-flakey), 1 lay
(my first ever, became a short-term girlfriend).

### Uninteresting Weaseling #1

Session on a friday evening. No approaches (I am a little bitch). 12
bona-fide weasels, but I *am* getting closer to approaching again—gave
multiple compliments, ~two of them to hot chicks.

Two standout moments.

One is when I saw two women (both not hot) circling a pigeon cramped
into a corner. I stopped, look for a couple seconds, and they explained
that the pigeon was sick and asked me whether I wanted to try to catch
it so that they could bring it to a veterinarian (?). For the fun of it
I agreed, but my beautifully executed front-stop didn't relax the bird,
which took off and flew away.

Second was an elf-like brunette gliding across the sidewalk the other
side of the street. I made up my mind to compliment her, but chickened
out the last second and found a less ethereally beautiful chick to
deliver my line to.

God, I can't wait to get back into some semblance of state. Up the
mountain we climb.

### Uninteresting Weaseling #2: Getting Rid of The Second-Order Crutches

Only five weasels, since the hot women were mainly walking around with
their boyfriends/in two-sets, and since it's a Sunday the shops aren't
open.

Didn't give a compliment to any guy (on his style/beard/whatever), and
"only" complimented three chicks—but all of them were good-looking
enough that I'd've also endorsed approaching them. The last one was the
best-looking, a small (eastern-european?) brunette.

From the weasels, two stand out particularly strongly: A fun-sized
red-head walking around on a market, aimlessly; and a tall elegant blonde
dressed completely in black. I saw the blonde twice but didn't have the
balls to talk to her. Ah well.
