Reports
=======

<!--What I did, why I did it, what the effects were, and whether I
recommend the thing-->

Sometimes, I perform little (and not so little) informal experiments.
Although I don't collect any data during the experiment, subjective
reports on their effects might be helpful for other people. Don't take
them too seriously.

Countings Smarts
----------------

### What I Did

When I was around 9 years old, I decided to create a counter
in my head that would increment when I saw a car of the brand
[Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(marque)). I did this for
around half a year, eventually reaching over 6000 (I don't remember
the exact number anymore, what a shame).  During this time, I created
some rules:

* I was not actively seeking out Smarts, but was looking out for them
* Because I'd learned the positions for Smarts in the village we were living in, I created a rule that a period of one hour was necessary for double-counting the same car
* Smarts of all varieties were valid

I remember location mattering a lot, a 2-week holiday in the US increasing
the counter by only 1 or two, and a weekend in a big european city
pushing the counter up by several hundred.

### Why I Did It

I don't remember my reasons for starting this. Perhaps I did it because
Smarts are relatively recognizable and I was bored.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

I think the effects on my life were (and are) pretty neutral, though my
visual classifier for Smarts is still much better than for other cars. I
also still get a little bolt of attention when I see a Smart.

Also, the sportscar variant of Smarts looks kind of neat, besides the
[Tesla Cybertruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck)
my preferred aesthetic for cars.<!--TODO: links for these-->

If you're a bored 9 year old, this is probably not too bad.

Eating Only Every Second Day
-----------------------------

### What I Did and Why I Did It

For two weeks in September 2018, I tried eating only every second day.
This ruled out any kind of nutritional intake on fasting days except
tap water.

I'd heard about people fasting for a week or more, and thought this
might be an interesting little experiment to try. I had no specific
reason for this particular spacing of fasting.

### What the Effects Were and Whether It Was a Good Idea

Apart from being quite hungry on the days when I didn't eat anything,
and eating a lot on the days when I was allowed to eat, there were no
interesting effects. I do not particularly recommend this.

Walking Barefoot
----------------

### What I Did and Why I Did It

From mid March 2019 to mid July 2019, I walked barefoot both inside the
house and outside.

I recall having read some people gesturing toward barefoot walking having
health benefits, but that was not my main reason for doing it, I wanted
to see whether it had any direct impacts on the quality of my life.

I stopped walking barefoot after steppipng into a glass shard for the
second time.

### What the Effects Were

The main effects were:

* In March, my feet were sometimes very cold when walking outside.
* I stepped into very small (2-4mm long) shards of glass twice, which I had to remove. That was kind of painful.
* People in my social circle were surprised, but tolerated it. I didn't have the feeling of losing many social opportunities.
* My feet became much more resilient against temperature & rough ground as time went on, in July I could run at full speed with relatively little pain.
* One day I slipped on a manhole cover during rain, and bent my ankle. It probably would have hurt less if I had worn shoes.
* My feet enjoyed much more varied and textured sensory input. (I was surprised by the difference in heat that different patches of road can have)
* I had to wash my feet everytime in entered my home, which was kind of annoying.
* I didn't have to put on shoes in the morning, giving me another minute in bed.
* I became very annoyed every time I saw glass shards on the pavement.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

Walking barefoot was kind of cool, especially the long-term hardening of
my feet. That said, for most people the downsides probably outweigh the
upsides by a lot. To my younger self, I would recommend doing it for 2
weeks in summer, and then stopping.
