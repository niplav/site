Sometimes, I perform little (and not so little) informal experiments.
Although I don't collect any data during the experiment, subjective
reports on their effects might be helpful for other people. Don't take
them too seriously.

Countings Smarts
----------------

### What I Did

When I was around 9 years old, I decided to create a counter
in my head that would increment when I saw a car of the brand
[Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_\(marque\)). I did this for
around half a year, eventually reaching over 6000 (I don't remember
the exact number anymore, what a shame). During this time, I created
some rules:

* I was not actively seeking out Smarts, but was looking out for them
* Because I'd learned the positions for Smarts in the village we were living in, I created a rule that a period of one hour was necessary for double-counting the same car
* Smarts of all varieties were valid

I remember location mattering a lot, a 2-week holiday in the US increasing
the counter by only 1 or two, and a weekend in a big European city
pushing the counter up by several hundred.

### Why I Did It

I don't remember my reasons for starting this. Perhaps I did it because
Smarts are relatively recognizable and I was bored. (Implications for
the likelihood of me being autistic are left to the reader.)

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

I think the effects on my life were (and are) pretty neutral, though my
visual classifier for Smarts is still much better than for other cars. I
also still get a little bolt of attention when I see a Smart.

Also, the [Smart roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Roadster)
looks kind of neat, together with the asthetic of the [Tesla
Cybertruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck) my preferred
aesthetic for cars.

If you're a bored 9 year old, this is probably not too bad.

Eating Only Every Second Day
-----------------------------

### What I Did and Why I Did It

For two weeks in September 2018, I tried eating only every second day.
This ruled out any kind of nutritional intake on fasting days except
tap water.

I'd heard about people fasting for a week or more, and thought this
might be an interesting little experiment to try. I had no specific
reason for this particular spacing of fasting.

### What the Effects Were and Whether It Was a Good Idea

Apart from being quite hungry on the days when I didn't eat anything,
and eating a lot on the days when I was allowed to eat, there were no
interesting effects. I do not particularly recommend this.

__3/10__

Walking Barefoot
----------------

### What I Did and Why I Did It

From mid March 2019 to mid July 2019, I walked barefoot both inside the
house and outside.

I recall having read some people gesturing toward barefoot walking having
health benefits, but that was not my main reason for doing it, I wanted
to see whether it had any direct impacts on the quality of my life.

I stopped walking barefoot after stepping into a glass shard for the
second time.

(The problem were not *big* shards, those were avoidable and didn't
cut when stepped on. Instead, small & basically invisible shards pose
a bigger problem, because they're hard to detect and just as abundant.)

### What the Effects Were

The main effects were:

* In March, my feet were sometimes very cold when walking outside.
* I stepped into very small (2-4mm long) shards of glass twice, which I had to remove. That was kind of painful.
* People in my social circle were surprised, but tolerated it. I didn't have the feeling of losing many social opportunities.
* My feet became much more resilient against temperature & rough ground as time went on, in July I could run at full speed with relatively little pain.
* One day I slipped on a manhole cover during rain, and bent my ankle. It probably would have hurt less if I had worn shoes.
* My feet enjoyed much more varied and textured sensory input. (I was surprised by the difference in heat that different patches of road can have)
* I had to wash my feet everytime in entered my home, which was kind of annoying.
* I didn't have to put on shoes in the morning, giving me another minute in bed.
* I became very annoyed every time I saw glass shards on the pavement.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

Walking barefoot was kind of cool, especially the long-term hardening of
my feet. That said, for most people the downsides probably outweigh the
upsides by a lot. To my younger self, I would recommend doing it for 2
weeks in summer, and then stopping.

Riding the Bike a Lot
---------------------

### What I Did

In October 2019, I decided to do all of my transportation either by foot
or by bike. I kept this up until February 2020.

This resulted in me biking on average ~25km a day for four months (my
way to university was ~20km, and sometimes I had to drive into the city
centre, which was another 10km).

During the time on my bike I usually listened to podcasts on my [IPod
Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Shuffle), mostly the [80,000
Hours Podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/).

### Why I Did It

I tried this to test several different things. I wanted to see how
independent of other methods of transportation I could be (public
transport, car etc.). I also wanted to observe whether these amounts
physical exercise and time spent outside (sometimes in the sun) would be
beneficial to me (both in terms of falling asleep easier in the evening
and becoming fitter).

I also wanted to see whether this was a good way of saving money for
public transport.

### What the Effects Were

I usually spent 2½ hours or more a day on my bike, very often under rough
conditions (cold weather, wind, me being tired/exhausted). Preparation
time for leaving the house was quite long: several minutes for packing
the backpack, adequately tying my shoes, putting on warm clothes (but
not too warm, since sometimes the weather was warm enough to being able
to leave the jacket inside my backpack), putting in the earphones, then
putting on the helmet, then gloves, and finally (if it was in the evening)
putting the lights onto the bike.

It doesn't sound like much, but doing this ~4 times a day (different
locations during the day) at two minutes, this cost me
`$4*2\hbox{min}*100=800\hbox{min} \approx 13.3h$`.

I was much hungrier in the evening, eating probably meals for 2 people.

I was usually very exhausted in the morning, making it harder to get out
of bed, and also during the day. Due to this, couldn't put as much energy
into university work as I would have wanted, leading to me receiving
quite bad grades during the semester.

I didn't notice my physical fitness improving very much except my legs
becoming much more muscular.

I had much less time during the day for hobbies and meeting friends.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

On the whole, **I do not recommend doing this** at all. It was a mistake
of me not aborting the experiment after a month, and the benefits were
tiny to non-existent. I was more tired, had worse grades, less social
contact, slept in longer and didn't become fitter during those four
months. The money I saved by not having to use public transport was tiny
in comparison.

The only scenario where I can imagine this being a good idea is if you
truly enjoy riding your bike a lot, have a lot of free time and relatively
short commutes.

The only positive effect of the whole experiment was that I listened to
a whole lot of podcasts during that time.

Mostly Stopping to Bite My Nails
---------------------------------

### What I Did and Why I Did It

I used to bite my nails quite a lot. This was both unsanitary and
not very attractive, but for a long time I did not attack the problem
systematically.

After talking with a friend about this, I realized that I had only [tried
trying](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3szfzHZr7EYGSWt92/p/WLJwTJ7uGPA5Qphbp "Use the Try Harder, Luke")
to stop biting my nails, and wanted to instead systematically attack
the issue.

I started by simply googling "How Do I Stop Biting My Nails" and read
[the first](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/stop-nail-biting-tips)
[two](https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Biting-Your-Nails) search results.

My first approach was to simply cut my fingernails whenever they became
too long.

### What the Effects Were

I now bite my nails 80% less than before I started cutting them regularly
(sometimes I forget cutting them, and then catch myself biting them
after they have become too long, but this happens relatively rarely).

I more often bite the skin around my nails, but still less than before
I was cutting them.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

Although my nailbiting is not completely solved yet, I have made
significant progress on something that had resisted many attempts at
"just powering it through" (another win of systems over willpower).
I am surprised I hadn't noticed in previous attempts at stopping to
bite my nails that i actually had to cut them instead—highly obvious
once you think about it for even a couple of seconds, but apparently
not clear to myself in the moment.

I am glad I tried the "just google “How To X” and read the first
couple of results" approach to a relatively pertinent problem in my life
that was bugging me for a long time. I plan to attack other problems in
my life similarly in the future.

### What I Did and Why I Did It

Around the end of 2019, I started meditating. I had read about jhanas
on the blog [Qualia Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com),
especially in the post [Investing Time and Resources in
Happiness](https://qualiacomputing.com/2019/04/03/investing-time-and-resources-in-happiness),
and thought it would be worthwhile to try meditation.

I started by reading [Mindfulness in Plain
English](./doc/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_gunaratana_1990.pdf),
and sitting for around 20 to 30 minutes a day, doing simple concentration
practice on the breath. I sometimes added 20 minutes or so of walking
meditation, focusing on the sensations from the feet and legs. Over the
course of 2020, I mostly continued my concentration practice, rarely
adding some loving-kindness or noting. During that time, after enjoying
the practice more and more, I expanded my meditation time to around 75
minutes a day.

As of November 2020, I have meditated 300 hours.

![Meditation Statistics for 2020](./img/meditation_2020/meditavo_chart.jpg "Meditation Statistics for 2020")

### What The Effects Were

Note: I ascribe many positive changes in my life to my meditation
practice. I feel like that is prudent, but inferring causality is very
difficult (especially over long time horizons), and it is possible that
I might be overrating my practice in its importance. That said, many of
the positive effects coincide pretty well with me starting my practice,
and seem to be similar to what other people are talking about.

Off the cushion, I noticed that my hedonic baseline increased by
around 15% (estimate, if such a number is indeed meaningful). I have
felt happier, more empathetic, more equanimous (and at the same time
more energized). I have learned to avoid many negative and unproductive
thought loops, and sometimes even addictive behavior (e.g. in relation
with the internet).

I sometimes experience a "dropping down into reality moment", where I
become acutely aware of the sensations in my body, or the sense of the
space around me, or the silence around me. This is always quite enjoyable.

I also experience negative sensations much less often, and if I do,
they last for a much shorter time and are less intense. For example,
I have noticed an 80% (again, estimate) reduction in

* Sadness
* Envy
* Jealousy
* Guilt
* Shame

The reduction of these negative states is partially (but not completely)
responsible for the raising of my hedonic baseline.

If I experience such states, it has become much easier to negotiate
with them by acknowledging their existence, observing them more closely,
and then "sending them down into the body". (I am not sure how coercive
this is, but at the moment, my best guess is that there is relatively
little coercion involved).

Ironically, while my meditation practice has noticeably improved most
aspects of my life, I do not notice as much progress in the quality of my
meditation as I would have expected. I have the impression that I tend
to experience less mind-wandering, and that my perception of sensations
is somewhat more clear, but that might just be a corollary of me fixing
my sleeping rhythm and not being quite tired during meditation.

Sometimes, most often during a one-hour sit, I enter a state that is
quite pleasant and clear. In it, I have no internal monologue, and feel
a pervasive inner silence (outer silence is also mostly present, though
I can still perceive auditory perceptions). There is also no drive to do
anything else/go anywhere else. Unfortunately, it always has disappeared
after only a few minutes.

But these kinds of states are relatively rare, and most of my meditation
sessions are like everyone else's: full of mind-wandering, short bursts
of attention on the breath etc. I do, however, enjoy meditation more
and more as time goes on.

### Whether I Recommend It

Recommending meditation, especially in the amounts that I do, is a very
risky move. Meditation can cause very negative states of mind, or lead
to mental changes that lead to radical changes in lifestyle. I have not
yet had any experience of e.g. the dukkha ñanas, but I have been well
informed about them, and have decided that the risk they pose can be
traded off against the benefits I have observed so far, and that other,
more advanced people have talked about.

If my descriptions have stimulated your curiosity, I do
recommend seeking out more information about meditation. If you
are relatively analytical, I can recommend the [/r/streamentry
wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/streamentry/wiki/index), as well as the
writings of [Daniel M. Ingram](https://integrateddaniel.info).

I also particularly recommend [Mindfulness in Plain
English](./doc/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_gunaratana_1990.pdf).

Attempted 7-Day Meditation Retreat at Home
------------------------------------------

### What I Did

At the beginning of October 2020, I planned doing a 7-day meditation
retreat at home. My initial plan was to do nothing but meditate for all
7 days, at ~10h of meditation a day. During that time, I planned on not
leaving the house, using the internet, visiting friends etc.

I used [this reddit
post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/393ktj/diy_10_day_meditation_retreat_at_home_mindfulness/)
as an inspiration for my schedule.

I removed all electronic devices from my room, keeping only my smartphone
(using it as a timer), but disabling nearly all apps & turning off wifi.

My schedule was to do sitting and walking meditation alternatingly,
1h each, and doing mostly concentration practice<!--TODO: anapanasati
for sitting, what for walking?-->.

### Why I Did It

At that time I had meditated ~250h, and had read several times that
retreats were the best option of inducing qualitative shifts in meditation
practice. But I didn't want to plan & pay for a meditation retreat just
yet, so I decided that I could try the cheaper option at home and see
how it worked out.

### What the Effects Were

I started the retreat off very strongly: Meditating for 10h each on the
first two days. Unfortunately, the social environment was not ideal for
intense practice, and I became less determined to continue practicing as
the days went on. I meditated 8, 6, ½, and 4 hours on the next 4 days,
leaving the seventh completely free.

However, the effects of doing intense concentration practice were still
quite strong. I had some episodes of very clear & vivid mindfulness,
following the breath easily for several minutes.

I did ½h of [mettā
bhāvanā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB), which convinced
me to incorporate more loving-kindness meditation into daily practice
as well.

On the evenings first and second day specifically, my head felt like a
swarm of busy tiny insects were performing a great amount of labour inside
of it—something was clearly happening, and I had the impression that
a lot of neural connections were being built.

### Whether It Was a Good Idea

Although I failed to stay consistent during the time and did not practice
as much as I wanted to, I am still very glad I did the retreat. My
concentration practice was markedly better afterwards, and it has helped
me in very subtle ways.

I now plan doing a retreat in the right social setting that encourages me
to be more disciplined about my practice.

I would tentatively recommend aiming for 2/3 days of intense practice
instead of 7, that seems a lot more doable on your own. But if you're
especially enthusiastic, you might very well succeed where I failed.

Looking Into A Mirror
----------------------

Reddit user [/u/Awarenesss](https://old.reddit.com/u/Awarenesss) posted [a
comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/k5qjxh/discussion_thread_20_december_2020/ggzvzp4)
on the [December 2020 Discussion
thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestar
codex/comments/k5qjxh/discussion_thread_20_december_2020/) on
[/r/slatestarcodex](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/), asking
for participants in a replication. I messaged them about my
interest in participation, and they replied with the following
instructions:

> Stare at your face in a mirror continuously for 10:00 minutes in dim
lighting conditions that still allow for the distinguishing of facial
features. Move and blink as little as possible. Eliminate visual and
audible distractions before starting.

The first time, I did not read the instructions carefully, and performed
the experiment under bright light. I noticed that mistake, and repeated
the experiment the next day under dim lighting.

I can pretty much report a null result: the ten minutes felt just like
me looking at my own face.

I was somewhat tired (despite (or maybe because?) sleeping more than 9
hours the night before), and often lost focus on my face. I more often
than not focused on certain features of my face, such as only the mouth,
nose, or one of the eyes. Some of the time (more than usually) I was
thinking about the attractiveness of my face (or the lack thereof).

At one point, while I was trying to focus on the whole of my face, for
a brief moment it looked detached from the rest of my head (like a mask
with my face being held infront of my head), and somewhat nearer to the
mirror than the rest of my head, but that illusion quickly disappeared
when I became more attentive.

### Threats to Validity

Several factors might distort my report.

1. I am doing a [somewhat intensive contemplative
practice](./reports.html#300_Hours_of_Meditation), and my perception is
perhaps already slightly different from the modal person's

2. I have some psychedelic experiences, although the last happened more
than 6 months ago, and seems to have had left relatively little long-lasting
effects

3. I remember reading about the experiment some time ago, and I'm
vaguely aware that an often-reported result is that people looking at
other peoples' faces or into the mirror report the faces transforming
into frightening grimaces.

4. I was disturbed mid-experiment by a person living with me, but the
distraction was not significant enough for me to consider repeating the
experiment again.

### Would I Recommend Doing This?

It could be a good concentration practice, perhaps similar to Kasina
meditation, because Everything is Kind of Like Meditation™.

Otherwise, I wouldn't see the point in it, other than doing someone
else a favour in their experiment.

Possible Erectile Dysfunction from an LSD Trip
-----------------------------------------------

[Chapin
2021](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/covid-19-took-my-sense-of-smell-then "COVID-19 Took My Sense of Smell, then LSD Brought it Back")
reports having cured his
post-[COVID-19](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)
[anosmia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia) by taking LSD.

I believe I have encountered a similarly strong reaction to taking LSD: I
currently put ~15% on my second LSD trip causing more than half of my past
[erectile dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction)
(which consists of a mix of psychological and physiological issues,
occurring both during masturbation and attempted sex, but not always and
to varying degrees, and beware: I didn't have a formal diagnosis). My
ED disappeared in early 2023 (~1½ years after it first appeared),
and I now guess guess that it was simply due to nervousness.

The potential causal pathways from the LSD trip to erectile dysfunction
are hard to convey to third parties, and quite speculative. I attribute a
strong [body load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_load), especially
in the genital area, together with a general feeling of discomfort and
feeling of "wanting to get somewhere but not knowing where"-ness, as well
as solidifying a psychological unease about sexuality in patterns of
tension in the genital area to causing the symptoms. I am very tempted
to also put the word "trauma" somewhere in the previous sentence. These
experiences reoccurred on my 3rd and 4th trip, although less strongly
(I continued taking LSD because I initially believed the results to be
largely positive).

However, inferring causality [is
hard](https://www.gwern.net/Causality), and humans are prone to
[self-deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wik/Self-deception) and
[confabulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation), so adjust
accordingly.

Even though I enjoyed many parts of my LSD trips, I would advise my past
self against repeating them.

Month-Long Meditation Retreat At Home
---------------------------------------

In August 2022, I decided to do a month-long meditation retreat together
with a friend in my apartment. We meditated for the entire month (he
continued afterwards), me doing on average ten hours of meditation a day;
if I remember correctly I never did less than eight hours on a single
day. At the beginning of the retreat, I'd meditated about 1k hours,
adding 300 more during the course of the month.

The retreat was almost completely silent except for ten to fifteen minutes
of talk about logistics in the evening and me speaking with a teacher on
the phone every third day. (I got a teacher as safety backstop in case
my psyche went off the rails, which didn't happen, but the teacher had
a useful suggestion that saved me some time.)

I allowed myself to read around in The Mind Illuminated<!--TODO:
link--> and Right Concentration<!--TODO: link--> and write
into my notebook during the retreat. I didn't end up writing
very much, but [one poem](./microfiction.html#Squeal) and [some
mathematics](./pergraphs.html) came of it. I ~almost completely refrained
from using the internet[^internet].

I didn't restrain myself from eating in the afternoon, and would often
eat directly before going to bed in order to avoid drowsiness during
meditation after meals. I don't understand why some meditation retreats
disallow late eating, to me it's one of the easiest way to get the
necessary calories while avoiding the annoying drowsiness and "zen nod"
after a meal.

I also didn't place any restrictions on my sexual activity —
that is, I didn't abstain from masturbation during the retreat. I
think that did me well and saved me from (even more) sexual
fantasizing while on the cushion that often plagues me during
e.g. [Goenka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.N.Goenka) retreats. I
don't think [abstinence has any effect on meditation session
quality](./quality.html) anyway.

[^internet]: I had a single lapse where I opened the YouTube app on my phone for about 15 minutes and watched three videos.

For the first 27 days my meditation practice was very
absorption/concentration-heavy with the goal of entering
the jhanas, on the last three days I switched to [Mahasi
Sayadaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasi_Sayadaw)-style
noting practice. In the absorption-focussed period
I'd start a meditation by settling down, then cultivate a
[brahmavihara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara) (at first
[mettā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metta) and later, at my teachers'
suggestion, [muditā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudita)) for about
ten minutes, and then switch to absorption on the breath (with various
amounts of counting the breath and focussing on small fast sensations
versus broad slow sensations in the wider body).

In the evening we'd listen to a dharma talk, including
some [kōans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan) from
the Waking Up app and some recordings of [Ṭhānissaro
Bhikkhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanissaro_Bhikkhu) (which later
got turned into his With Each and Every Breath<!--TODO: link-->).

Meditations were usually an hour long, alternating between sitting and
walking. I'd usually try to time it so that I did walking meditation
directly after lunch. Towards the end of the retreat I gravitated to
90-minute sits, which felt like a titanic ocean of time, and taught me
some equanimity towards unpleasant sensations in my legs.

So: How did it go?

I'd say it went mediocre, about 25th percentile of what I'd expected. (I
had high expectations.)

### 1st Jhana

I did enter the first jhana on the 21st day, and was able to enter it
sporadically in the days afterwards, but didn't graduate to being able
to access any of the other jhanas. My guess is that I have a hard time
generating [sukha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukha), as my first
jhana is almost completely [pīti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piti).
When I entered the first jhana, it was almost exclusively in the evening
during the last or second-to-last sit of the day.

### That Other Equanimous Thing

I had one experience which I can't quite place: I was in the first jhana,
and attempted to shed the piti to drop into the second jhana. But instead
of landing in a purely happy state, I entered an incredibly equanimous,
calm, crisp, clear, crystalline, relaxed, and open state. In that state I
was sharply aware of the (often uncomfortable) sensations in my shoulders
and legs, but didn't mind them very much, they were just happening on my
body. To be metaphoricaly, I felt like a huge crystal in which sensations
simply bouncing from one facet to the other or snaking along in faults
along the surface, the underlying substrate completely unperturbed by
the content of the sensations. The saying "awareness is unsullied by
the contents that pass through it" comes to mind.

The main factor of this state was equanimity, and a ~lack of inner
monologue.

In this state I tried to follow Brasington's instructions to enter the
fifth jhana by expanding the subjective space around me, but didn't
succeed.

My best guess is that I (for lack of sukha) just had to jump over
it and enter the third jhana<sub>25%</sub>, though the descriptions
I've read sound more similar to me having experienced the fourth
jhana<sub>15%</sub>.

If I had to guess I'd say it lasted about 20 minutes, and it's probably
my favourite [quale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quale) to this day.
The incredible calm, depth and width of it is really just something else.

### Noting Practice

My noting practice in the last three days was fun and, while not
fundamentally fruitful, still quite revealing. Towards the end of the 2nd
day my perception was becoming very "thin", I believe Shinzen Young has
used the phrase "paperthin and featherlight" which closely corresponds to
my memory of the experience.

It was as if there was a giant nothingness behind a thin film of my
perception, and for some sensory modalities it felt a bit like sensations
were popping out of that nothingness into my field of perception, and
then getting sucked back into it immediately afterwards. The nothingness
had a friendly quality to it. (Not sure how to describe it any better
than that.)

### Miscellanea

During the dharma talk one night I did a little bit of IFS type work
while thinking about my mother, in interactions after the retreat I had
the impression that I could engage much more fruitfully with her.

My sense of smell became more acute and I was able to more keenly smell
my armpits.

During the course of the retreat a strong painful pinching in my shoulders
that had plagued me during my previous (Goenka) retreat slowly subsided.

I noticed that one of the strongest tendencies of my mind is to
compulsively __think__, to a degree that becomes almost painful during
long retreats. The thinking is split between intellectual topics,
sexual/status fantasies, and thinking about what I would want to write
(including my mind enjoyably writing poetry).

Over the duration of the retreat I was sleeping
less and less, and my other data points [in the same
direction](./increasing.html#Analysing_my_Data), but unfortunately I
wasn't collecting sleep data at the time. I was going to bed consistently
around midnight during the retreat, in the beginning waking up around
08:30, which shifted towards 06:00 at the end of the retreat.

During the retreat I realized that I very much dislike violence in TV
series and movies, and that Western culture has it exactly the wrong way
around in terms of displaying violence vs. sex in film. Violence, you see,
is usually *bad*, and sex is usually *good*, but we find it completely
acceptable for someone to watch highly violent content on their device
on public transport, but look down on people consuming erotic content.

I think this holds especially for exposing children to such
content: On the retreat I was strongly reminded of being
traumatized by seeing violence and death on TV (e.g. a man
struggling with asphyxiation after having been hanged, or shortly
before the retreat by the particularly hopeless scenes in [Squid
Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_game)), and not being able to
come up with any similarly traumatizing memory wrt sexuality (and instead
remembering that I found sexuality curious as a child, and vaguely wanted
to know more about it).

As such, I decided to strictly limit the amount of violence I expose
myself to via visual media.

### End of the Retreat

After the end of the retreat I connected back with my devices to the
outside world and indulged in the internet for an entire night (I didn't
sleep, and didn't feel particularly tired).

While listening to music that night I had a strong experience of the
aforementioned feeling of sensations popping out of the void and getting
pulled back into it, together with a very high sensory resolution. I
noticed that music was particularly *good*, a very clean source of
pleasure (mostly not bound to status games, positive-sum &c).

The days after the retreat felt very pleasant. My mind was incredibly
light and *clean*, as if someone had powerwashed my psyche. Especially
the first day after the retreat everything was simply delightful. I
especially remember a small group of sparrows flying around the garden,
causing me to burst into grinning and laughter as I saw them while
walking along. These effects subsided within three to four days, as I
wasn't meditating anymore.

I *did* notice how I was much more adept at interacting with people in
the period after the retreat, being able to hold much more space for
them in conversation. When I went to a nightclub four days after the
end of the retreat a woman initiated making out with me, which is the
first and last time that has ever happened to me.

### Learnings

I believe that this retreat was premature. I should probably have done at
least one or maybe even two or three shorter (i.e., ≤ten day) retreats
before jumping into the deep end of the pool — I'd only done a single
Goenka retreat before, and two 2-3 day long mini-retreats. I also made the
mistake of focusing too much on absorption meditation, probably bashing
my head into the wall while being blocked by emotional factors (as the
rapid progress with emotional issues concerning my parents suggests,
having only spent half an hour on it during the entire retreat).

But I also guess that my psyche is in a very strong default basin
that is not unpleasant to me, and that it *doesn't* have incredibly
vast reservoirs of trauma and and hurt built up. (I have some more
evidence for that belief, having gone trauma-hunting on two separate
MDMA self-therapy sessions which didn't bring up *that much* stuff,
plus partial exploration on another meditation retreat).

My current best guess is that I'll want to (1) bring up as much
trauma/hurt as I can handle with some destabilizing practice, and then
(2) work through it with e.g. Core Transformation or Coming to Wholeness
or simply bog-standard therapy. But if I just don't find much material
I'll have to resign myself to even longer retreats that focus more on
high-energy insight practices.

### Would I Recommend Doing This?

If you've done cumulatively more than a month of retreat in shorter
meditation retreats *and* have someone who wants to do such a retreat
with you *and* you feel the desire to make a lot of meditation progress
*and* have felt, if not underwhelmed, then at least not shaken up enough
by shorter retreats, then yes, otherwise no. I wouldn't have been able
to do this retreat alone, and was incredibly lucky to have had a good
friend with a similar level of dedication and free time.

I will probably do more long retreats in the future, hopefully with
more fruitful outcomes. I've learned and reoriented.

If anyone reading this lives in Europe and wants to do a retreat together,
[shoot me an email](./about.html#Contact). I'm most interested in doing
fire kasina for about two weeks at the time of writing this, but would
be happy to try something else.
