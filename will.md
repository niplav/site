Creating Libertarian Free Will
================================

The philosophical literature is rich in discussions about [free
will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-Will): Whether beings (usually
humans[^1]) can make choices that are not, in some sense, "completely
determined" by the causal forces of nature. I won't take
any position in that debate here, but instead will ask a
far less explored question:

__If [libertarian free
will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_free_will) *does not*
exist, would it be good to bring it into existence?__

[^1]: Though even here we may consider possibilities similar to the ones [Shalizi](http://bactra.org/notebooks/some-meta-ethical-positions.html) dicusses: What if free will is possible, but only a few species in the past had it, or only a few species in the future will have it, but not *homo sapiens*? What if there are inanimate objects that *have* free will, but choose not to exercise it? What if some humans<!--TODO: link Aaronson anecdote--> have free will, but others don't, or if all humans have free will as a latent ability, but have failed to notice and deploy it? Humans may not have free will themselves, but be theoretically able to create beings with free will… it's just that, by the way the universe is structured, we never will.
