A Religion
==========

Ingredients
-----------

### Timelessness

<!--Use the Zero-Ontology by Pearce here?-->

Which language has a word for it?  
I do not know.  
At which place does one find this realm?  
There is none.  
Just at the brink of eternity,  
just at the edge of heat death,  
there is Timelessness.  
Vast, there, everything exists,  
since it's just as good as nothing.  
Just as everything causes something  
here nothing does.  
Just as empty space bubbles with particles  
or humans breath in existence  
Nothing bubbles with being.  
I can not ask  
what causes them to separate–  
Every word in that question is misplaced.  
For clarity, I may suggest:  
"It being".  
Good luck with that.  

### Tegmark's Mathematical Universe

Number and symbol,  
function and manifold,  
category and set  
blooming;  
∅ throning above all.  
Every one of them  
raying, emeraldly, forth  
into all possible universes<!--TODO: here cosmos instead, but plural-->.  
One of them ours,  
one of the ℵ₁ behindforth there.
