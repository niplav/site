On Daygame
===========

I'm not an intellectual, I'm just a
guy who likes to fuck. But getting laid is a
[thing](https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-thingness-of-things.html)
with regularities that can be learned, and an ecosystem with different
niches. One of them is daygame, and it's been my favorite for years.

1) What
--------

There's no widely accepted definition of daygame, and the standard
textbooks[^1] don't offer one. (They go straight to the chase.) Here's
mine:

__Daygame__ is the craft of walking up to women in public, and talking
to them with the intention of dating or sleeping with them.

[^1]: Beginner [Daygame](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36009850-beginner-daygame), [Daygame Nitro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166195305-daygame-nitro) and Daygame Mastery<!--TODO: add mastery link-->.

Utilitarians:
--------------

From a utilitarian perspective, daygame doesn't matter. Go focus on
shrimp and receding galaxies.

But, like, still, is daygame *net good*? For others, that is, not for me.

Insofar that daygame is good (or bad) for others, there's two obvious
groups that can be considered: The women being approached, and the world
in general.

### For Women

My current position "Skillful daygame is slightly net positive, with
medium variance".

### For The World

Violating [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel's_Law),
SYN-flooding<!--TODO: link-->.

The Alternatives
-----------------

### "Just Be Yourself" and Its Cousins

### Social Circle "Game"

### Online »“Game”«

### Nightgame
