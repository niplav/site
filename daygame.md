On Daygame
===========

I'm not an intellectual, I'm just a
guy who likes to fuck. But getting laid is a
[thing](https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-thingness-of-things.html)
with regularities that can be learned, and an ecosystem with different
niches. One of them is daygame, and it's been my favorite for years.

1) What
--------

There's no widely accepted definition of daygame, and the standard
textbooks[^1] don't offer one. (They go straight to the chase.) Here's
mine:

__Daygame__ is the craft of walking up to women in public, and talking
to them with the intention of dating or sleeping with them.

[^1]: Beginner Daygame, Daygame Nitro and Daygame Mastery.

Utilitarians:
--------------

From a utilitarian perspective, daygame doesn't matter. Go focus on
shrimp and receding galaxies.
