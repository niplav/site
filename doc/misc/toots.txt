I think the question boils down to whether one thinks that experts are better than random (or better than one's own guess) or instead worse than random because of intentional truth-obfuscation.If experts just lie egoistically, then I *think* that the accuracy of their reported opinions depends on the type of social game being played (and how large the payoffs are):

I.e., in a positive-sum game you might be better off deceptive enough if it's competitive, and report correct beliefs if the game is cooperative.

Perhaps I'm just failing to see that there is a war going on because of my mistake theory bias. Are experts *intentionally deceptive*? I feel like the payoffs for that are too thin-spread and

Content: @velartrillThanks for your answer!I think we differ mainly in our belief about how smart & capable individuals are with regard to their own decisions, relative to governments/institutions/tradition.I think abortion or trans women in female bathrooms are interesting cases. (My view on abortion hinges on the moral patienthood of fetuses, which I haven't looked much into, but I have downloaded some relevant papers, which must count for *something*). Trans people in bathrooms is one case where

Content: These are the five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. But when the mind is freed from these five defilements, it becomes malleable, wieldy,and luminous, pliant and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. Then, there being a suitable basis, one is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which one might incline the mind.

Content: Serious post: if you plan on buying a diamond \"as an investment\", consider not doing that.Humans can produce lab diamonds at 10% of the price and higher purity than natural , and I expect the process to improve on both axes. And making a synthetic diamond dirtier is way easier than purifying a natural one. There's also some developments in making quite big synthetic diamonds. So yeah, if you're buying a diamond *as an investment*, you're speculating on market irrationality.

Content: @dredmorbiusGreat question! Several interpretations are possible, let me cartese:Idea defined narrowly, worst in terms of consequences: leaded fuel (arguably responsible for a huge amount of crime on the 70s)Idea defined narrowly, worst in terms of factual wrongness: probably something we don't know about, but a decent contender is Aristotelian physics (despite being pretty empiricist, Aristotle definitely didn't check this one)

Content: @dredmorbiusIdea defined broadly, worst in terms of consequences: Religion (esp. Aztec) maybe? Seems a viciously strong attractor in belief space, undermining hella lot of empiricism and systematic flexibility. Perhaps Marxism, but I'd like more research about counterfactual industrialization in Russia & China - would the tsarists/kuomintang also have industrialized this heavily?

Content: @dredmorbiusIdea defined broadly, worst in terms of factual correctness: a great many contenders, I'll probably go with Religion again. Probably some strong cult attractor which isn't just wrong, but structured in a way that prevents you from ever learning anything true again. Modern Islamist fundamentalism seems like this, and inquisition - if you kill everybody who believes differently, nobody can convince you you're wrong *taps head*

I knew my answers might be contentious, and didn't think about the question very long, so I might be mistaken (there's an interesting effect going on here, especially with ideologies: were they causal in bad consequences or just justifications for atrocities that would've happened otherwise as well?).

Content: I have an emotional problem with a lot of far-left thinking:I think it contains a lot of very bad and untrue memes, but those are not clearly formulated. I can't be bothered to spell them out to people that implicitly hold them bc I'm lazy, but they also annoy me a lot, so I parrot anti-leftwing talking points that are pretty unskillfull. I could either try to reason out my problems with individuals, which takes a lot of time and often leads nowhere, or try to ignore it.

Content: @p @sjw @Moon @jeffcliff @ademan yeah, using the word \"fitness\" in evolutionary bio was a mistake—people interpret it as \"strength\", but it might better be called \"adaptedness\" (itmight also be boiled down to the number of grandchildren an organism has). Adaptability isn't the sole criterion for fitness, though—many species are highly specialized and thrive in niches (just as some programming languages do).

Content: @Azure I guess it depends on the type of nihilism, and how exactly you implement it, butIf you have normative nihilism, the question \"is X good or bad\" is a question with undefined words. \"Is this postbox quibbled?\" I don't know! Similarly, nihilism about meaning (I don't like the word) would prevent any judgements about stuff, because you're again throwing a \"meaning not found\" error.Evem if you're anxious about stuff \"no purpose!\" , nihilism says \"meh\" and continues not judging anything.

(I tried to read Nietzsche years ago and didn't understand him)I had my last meaning crisis at 14, so it's been a while since I could sympathize with these kinds of questions. From my pov, I already care about what I care about, and that's all that matters for normativity (modulo some metapreferences). \"where do I get my values from, if it's not God?\" \"you already have them here, I don't understand the question\"Your caring is more ethically powerful than any supernova.

Content: @Azure It's weird, but in some way I find Kaczynski's manifesto respectable? He takes existential risks seriously, he has some notion of inhuman processes gobbling up all value in human affairs, while humans just stand at the side and watch while it happens. I guess the main disagreement is something along the lines of optimism about good-case outcomes, plus skepticism that hunter-gatherers had it that well. (also the whole transition period thing)I find the left really weird.

Content: @why @nosleep @vriska @georgia @methyltheobromine in computer science, there's different levels how hard a problem is to solve. These levels have names like P, NP, BQP etc. One of them is PSPACE, which sounds a bit like pee-space, and perhaps the problem of aiming pee with an erection is pee-space hard (I. E. Both computationally difficult and a hard dick aiming pee in space)Thanks, now I feel dirty

Content: Despite close connection in spirit [Chapin 2022, Cammarata 2021, Sotala 2019], few scholars have investigated the relation between microblogging and ancient buddhist scripture, especially the Tipitaka. However, multiple connections arise, for example the four brahmaviharas (the divine abodes) [Sujiva 2003, Buddhaghosa 500] and certain quaternionic spaces (or “tetraspaces”) [Minkowski 1908, Hamilton 1843, holomanga 2019], pointing at interesting connections between fourfold symmetries and benevol

Content: one thing niplav culture started doing very early was to group niplavs into group of 2-4 people who would form a worker/research unit (friendship encouraged, but romance discouraged). because of high agreeability, these units can be *very* stable, and are especially useful in trying to understand & solve difficult problems, often by one niplav being the babble and the other being the prune. this also has the advantage that for a niplav, intellectual work is around three times as fun together

Content: mainly because there is some very quick feedback mechanism that bores into weak points of understanding or sloppy parts of models/proofs, where a single niplav would just shrug and give up early.an optimal session is two niplavs at a whiteboard, either both thinking, or one explaining an idea to the other, and a third sitting at a laptop in the background and writing down the ideas as they're developed (and only sometimes asking questions for clarification).

Content: the similarity to pair programming is not coincidental, but as in pair programming, this works best if the problem is actually quite difficult and critical, since otherwise it's not economically viableniplav culture mostly acknowledges this, but takes the productivity hit by using these groups in settings where they're not necessarily optimal (although it is surprising how synchronized and fast a group of niplavs can be if they have been working together for a decade)

Content: there has been a large amount of experimentation to find psychological characteristics of niplavs that are especially conducive for forming these kinds of groups or pairs, and a large portion of the teenage years of a niplav is spent in various different groups to find an especially well-functioning one.these groups also work very well as ways of quickly organizing commitments, e.g. for meditation, exercise, artistic projects etc.

URL: https://schelling.pt/@niplav/107847939907068797
Content: one disadvantage is the huge variety of interests a niplav can have, it is often not possible to find a pair/group where every niplav is at the same time interested in bebop, type theory, bouldering and forecasting. usually, this is solved by having one primary group that is broadly intellectual, and then side-projects, with elaborate rules about how to deal with these side-groups becoming more important than the main group.

Content: this is less of a problem than one might suspect, because niplavs are generally easily made enthusiastic about most topics, niplavs are agreeable and willing to try the stuff other niplavs think are cool, motivated to stay in their group because they have grooved in a very strong rhythm, more capable of understanding why something is cool (because of short inferential distances), and the groups are carefully chosen to maximize potential common interests.

That would be 20 years more than the average person in 1800.3.1.2 I don't know how this looks like if you control for child mortality, but I would bet on it still coming out positive.4.

Content: I wonder whether there is mathematics about the combinatorics of turning directed graphs into DAGs and DAGs into path graphs (maybe with the intermediate step of trees?).This feels kind of relevant to AI alignment: If we have the right level of abstraction (i.e. we don't just overfit to human behavior and biases), one way we can represent inconsistent preferences is via directed graphs (fully connected?). But we would like to turn these inconsistent preferences into consistent ones.

Content: Example: If we have a cycle graph ({a,b,c},{(a,b),(b,c),(c,a)}), then we can turn it into a path graph by removing any of the three edges (three ways of pathizing the graph).If we have a DAG ({a,b,c,d},{(a,b),(a,c),(b,d),(c,d)}) where b and c are deemed incomparable, we can turn that into a path graph in two different ways: either putting c before b or b before c (two ways of pathizing the graph).There's probably some recursive thing going on here, if we have more complex graphs.

Content: While this wouldn't tell us *how* we should make preferences consistent, it could give us a way of determining which ways of making preferences consistent exist and are more complex (maybe penalizing deleting edges differently from merging or adding edges?).I should try to find out whether this has been done before, and if it hasn't, I really want to look into this more.

(how do normal people handle interacting after one has romantically rejected the other? the ~2 times i have experienced it, it was always just __awkward__ and odd, is there no standard social script?

(not success). (this is furthermore worsened by the fact that you are probably not calibrated & smooth and can handle rejection well, or the other person can't handle rejecting well.

Content: @TetraspaceGroupingHm.If forecasters make predictions about the decisions of A 1 year in the future, then to epistemically dominate A by copying their conclusions, they would need to do the same work as A for that year.(This might be the case if you're talking about hedge funds, but then I fear funding of prediction markets becomes your bottleneck (disclaimer: I have not read the relevant paper, and only know ~third hand that you need to logarithmically subsidise prediction markets))

Content: there is this property of Doneness that I really like, and that tracks a lot (but not all) of my interests. First, let's take meditation: every single moment in meditation is really Done after it's over, it doesn't linger around, the sensations don't pile up somewhere. They might influence each other, sure, but at the end of the day it's just the present experience, slashing into and out of existence in its clear luminosity.

Content: second, there's predictions. a prediction is Done when it's made. you could add comments, explanations, models &c, but the prediction can be Done and stand there on its own. (there is a slight problem with the fact that predictions need to be updated over time, though, so there is some Piling there as well).

Content: third, let's look at daygame. if you ask someone out in a social circle/hobby group, that leaves residual social cruft lying around: awkwardness & mutual avoidance. the whole thing is not Done the way it is when you get cleanly rejected on the street. (online dating has a similar quality of Doneness to it, I think, but matches might stack up and old leads might spring to life sometime, but that's the same with DG).

The Metaculus correlations are close to zero in the first ~15 months, then dip into negative correlations (around -0.2) until month ~35, then rise to positive correlations (around 0.15) until month 40, and then start oscillating wildly (shortly afterwards the data for Metaculus correlations ends).

The p-values for Metaculus start out around 10⁻⁶, then jump around between 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻² in the first 15 months, and then dip down in the range of 10⁻²⁵ to 10⁻³⁵, and then recover back to 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻² until the end of the Metaculus dataset.

Content: none of the two worldwars took place on US soil, and the US entered both conflicts relatively late, so there is less US cultural knowledge about them (mostly in the form of “relative X went overseas and died/came back traumatized”). but in europe, the countries were the place the WWs were happening. and they experienced a different way how those conflicts came to play: countries interfering in the affairs of other countries.

Rather, what they say rests upon incorrect/problematic/biased/heavily spun assumptions. One type of case is when a short statement is the spearhead of a larger cluster of thought you don’t find valid*.\"

Content: @Arcana> My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally or too tedious. (Conscientiousness is often lacking online or in volunteer communities⁠⁠18 and many useful things go undone.) Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful⁠⁠—if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then

Content: @Arcana > even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself⁠⁠⁠. (Even experienced professionals can only write at their peak for a few hours a day—usually first thing in the morning⁠, it seems.) Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to time.

I think I agree with \"Markdown is not expressive enough\", but I alsos believe that it goes a really long way, much farther than many people expect & need (but I should be careful in not overstating it, since I routinely use embedded TeX & HTML tables to make up for it).I have never tried org mode, heeding the warnings that it is more addictive than heroin (and also it's part of emacs, which, yea…).

The CW \"Homophobia\" still carries its initial meaning, as would the CW \"Racism\" or \"Sexism\", you can look at the CW \"blergh\" and guess that it's a novelty CW, probably not hiding anything you'd find triggering.I would agree that it's harmful if someone uses the \"blergh\" CW to hide racist content.

It's not expected that you are discoverable that way, you're discovered by interaction with other users, and discover other users by seeing them interact on your timeline. AFAIK it's not possible to follow a server.Yeah, no cryptographic authentication in the case of migration.

Not a furry myself, and no higher-order desires to become one, but I imagine plushy Shkadov-thrusters could be neat.My competitive advantage is patience, which is not an advantage if one believes that there's ~15 years left until things start getting really out-of-distribution.I like valence, simplicity & long sites

Content: @Arcana @sophon so my current stance is that if you believe everything worse than civilizational collapse is quite likely  (let's say >30%) within the next 20 years it probably doesn't make sense to sign up (I haven't run the numbers on this tho). I haven't fully updated/acted on this bc recalcitrance.I'm less than 30 years old, and I pay ~600€ per year for my head-only cryonics contract (and if I die soon I don't pay anything on top of that). Life insurance becomes more expensive with age

Content: @Arcana @sophon I'm at Alcor, which makes the whole thing more expensive, but they handle logistics in case of death. Cryonics Institute is ~$20k IIRC, but they don't handle transport & logistics, which is very meh if you don't live in the US (I don't). But if you're on a smaller budget, CI is much better (depending on your acceptable level of risk tho). Not sure how robust the whole logistics stuff is anyway, Alcor has never had a case in the country where I live and when I asked them they 🤷

Content: @Arcana @sophon CI has membership costs of ~$100 a year, but you can get rid of those if you pay $1000 up front. Everything else is life insurance. Alcor has maybe $300 upfront cost for the signup, ~$550 per year membership cost, and I pay peanuts for the life insurance (and probably will for the next ~20 years).

Content: @roboguy @favonia Thanks a lot for the answer! I was wondering whether the category the Yoneda embedding transforms into is just Set, but it looks like something more complex (maybe summarising it that the hom-functors between the hom functors of a category and an arbitrary functor F to Set is in correspondence with F, but that's of course not an intuitive understanding).

I have also heard the statement that we already produce enough food, and distribution is the problem.Seems true, but maybe there's a premium in there that richer countries pay for redundancy in production?Otherwise yeah I think shipping is probably the best thing to think about, and apparently it wasn't a huge cost back in 2003[1] (which brings up the question why it costs ~60$ for me to ship a 1kg package to a friend in texas) 🤔 [1]: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/08/how_high_are_tr.html

Content: @SherilIf I were more optimistic, I'd probably be worrying about that kind of thing: We've built up technology & science stacks that add abstractions, but abstractions are leaky and can only go so far, so our setup to teach people those towers becomes more and more fragile over time (civilizational jenga!)Growing intelligence would assuage that, and growing population would be helpful (more specialization possible), but neither is happening rn 😕

Content: @sophon Ok, this is good! I believe I disagree a bunch with you :-) I think Nate would say that his arguments might not apply when applied to systems that aren't gradientspawn? I think a big bulk comes from the question what \"90% aligned\" means, perhaps? If I write an algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, usually what \"90% correct\" refers to means it's not going to give me the spanning tree, ever. If you have a MNIST classifier that 90% works that's probably okay.

The part of phase-space where humans can exist is pretty tiny (I don't know enough physics but if I had to guess it might even have measure zero)? If we make a box around that part of phase space where each dimension is 90% aligned then the volume occupied by the \"aligned region\" is still a really small part. My belief is that if your AI changes a lot of stuff and everything is not really well

Do you, by chance, mean \"low impact\" when you use \"corrigible\"? If not, I don't understand your argument. (I remain uncertain whether there's a \"basin of corrigibility\" or not, my intuitions point weakly toward \"no\"). If yes, then I don't think it's neccessarily \"tiles the lightcone with paperclips\", but more something like

I think this is a real danger, but that would be a great problem to have because that means we have some impact measure that *actually works* and tiles, and we could just, like, not set λ 0.2 too high. I think that kind of thing is super cool & good and I really like stuff like AUP.

Content: @sophon I think a system can be weak-corrigible & not low impact (yes, technically you could push the button and it'd shut down but it performed catastrophic actions that killed you)if you want strong-corrigibility you'd need some specification of the thing that can turn you off (you don't want to be turned off by some natural process), which makes it human-concept-laden (and maybe even value-laden), and the whole advantage of corrigibility is supposed to be value-agnosticism

Content: @sophon That depends on having a concept of where & what the programmer is, right? That's the part where I squint suspicicously: The programmer is is a human concept and I wouldn't by default expect it to be inferred (e.g. a naive failure case is that the AGI infers that the programmer is DeepMind and tries its very hardest to prevent DeepMind from going bankrupt, but doesn't care the slightest about any individual human)

Content: I remember (from listening to a bunch of podcasts by German hackers from the mid 00s) a strong vibe that the security of software systems at the time and earlier was definitely worse than what would've been optimal for the people making the software (definitely not safe enough for the users!).I wonder whether that is (1) true and (if yes) (2) what led to this happening!Maybe companies were just myopic when writing software then, and could've predicted the security problems but didn't care?

Content: Or was it that the error in prediction was just an outlier, that companies and industries on average correctly predict the importance of safety & security, and this was just an outlier.Or is this a common occurrence? Then one might chalk it up to (1) information asymmetries (normal users don't value the importance of software security, let alone evaluate the quality of a given piece of software) or (2) information problems in firms (managers had a personal incentive to cut corners on safety).

Content: Another reason might be that lower-level software usually can make any security issues a reputational externality for end-user software: sure, in the end Intel's branch predictor is responsible for Meltdown and Spectre, and for setting cache timeouts too low that we can nicely Rowhammer it out, but what end-user will blame Intel and not \"and then Chrome crashed and they wanted my money\".

Others can either join in (add stake) or in a grou you can then have a KBC-ish thin

Content: @flengyel As for EA doing \"what is measurable in the short term and thus reportable to the capitalist media\" — seems false to me. Certainly a lot of wild & out-there stuff with long or non-existent feedback loops (longtermism and trying to prevent extinction) and vague \"improve public decision making\" goals.So I like the opposite critique more: EA is *not* doing what it promised to, namely doing the things that are beneficial from a short-term very quantitative perspective.

I consider \"there's inequality\" a separate problem and to be addressed separately, e.g. by redistribution.

I think the type of philosophy/math/cs needed for successful strawberry alignment is close enough to regular theorem-proving that AI systems that aren't seeds for worldcrunchers would still be very helpful.(Doesn't feel to me like it touches the consequentialist core of cognition, a lot of philosophy is tree-traversal and finding inconsistent options, and math also feels like a MCTS-like thing)Is the advantage we'd have by good alignment theorist ML systems 1.5x or 10x or 100x?

But their plan is sound in that regard).But I disagree with the view that you can't have the alignment theorist that is not also a consequentialist.

Hard to have info about humans leak over though.How much of strawberry alignment is value-laden? 5%? 95%? probably further along some logarithmic scale, if I had to bet

Content: @sundogplanets Ah, I see. Is aluminum more harmful to the atmosphere or people than silicates?Skimming Wikipedia doesn't give me anything that sounds dangerous (some slight environment effects such as inhibiting gill-breathing in acidic water and plant-growth on acidic soil).I wonder how much aluminum ground-based entities emit into the atmosphere.

Insofar as there is overlap, I expect the individuals to hold individually sort-of consistent opinions (e.g. they read the privacy policy for every software and decide individually).I expect a common perspective to be that data analytics should be opt-in  and then it's fine. Or in other scenarios there might be some hypocrisy (QS for me, but not for thee), but that's not inconsistent.

It was doing no real work at all, but just before the credit/blame assignment phase, it quickly cycled through all the new concepts, and when it found one with high Worth it put its own name down as one of the creditors. Nothing is \"wrong\" with that policy, except that in the long ran it fails to lead to better results.Does this already count as an inner optimizer?(from “The Nature of Heuristics” p. 34)

Content: Let f be a function that takes as input an inconsistent preference i and produces a set C of consistent preferences. Let S be the set of subgraphs of i for which it holds that for every s∈S: s is an acyclic subgraph, s is a subgraph of i, and s is maximal in i for those properties.S shall contain all s that fulfill the above conditions.Let PCS be the property that for every s∈S, s is a subgraph of at least one c∈C (every consistent subpreference appears at least once in a consistent version)

Content: Then you have the following impossibilities:• PCS and f has polynomial runtime. (Proof sketch: finding an s of size k is in NP. Finding all of them is in NP as well.)• PCS and C has polynomial size. (Proof sketch: You can construct a graph with exponentially many acyclic tournaments as subgraphs).

Content: • PCS and all c∈C have minimum graph edit distance of i. (Proof sketch: There is a graph for which all acyclic tournaments with the same (minimal) graph-edit distance don't contain a specific subgraph). Graph in picture, the minimal edit distance is 3, the non-preserved consistent subgraph is a2→a4. This extends to arbitrarily big consistent subgraphs (replace all edges with acyclic tournaments with n nodes).

Content: @pixelherodev@fosstodon.org @drewdevault@fosstodon.org @dym I agree that instituting a carbon tax that captures the true externalities cost of the training & running would probably increase the cost to users, though I'd venture a guess that this would not dissuade OpenAI from training & running the system at the given demand.Let's see. 100mio. customers. Let's say 1% of those pays for plus. $20/month for a year is $2.4 mio./year.

Content: @pixelherodev@fosstodon.org @drewdevault@fosstodon.org @dym  If you spend 1% of that on carbon offsetting you can purchase carbon offsets for $24k, which amounts to ~250 tons of carbon (at ~$100 for capturing a ton of carbon[1], using things like preventing rainforest deforestation, and this report[2] says it's more like $10). This page[3] estimates that training chatGPT produced ~550 tons of carbon.[1]: https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-most-cost-effective-way-buy-carbon-offsets[2]: https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change, p. 83[3]: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-carbon-footprint-of-chatgpt-66932314627d

Content: @pixelherodev@fosstodon.org @drewdevault@fosstodon.org @dym Fair enough. Direct carbon capture is ~10x more expensive (as the MIT article claims, ~$1200/ton). This would indeed make it more difficult to pay the externality.

Content: Forecasting is Worse is Better The Brier score was invented in 1950, Bayes' theorem was first described in 1763, and probability theory was properly invented at the beginning of the 18th century.However, attempting to use forecasting to seriously determine the probability of future events, training & selecting people for their forecasting ability and creating procedures that incorporate both intuition-based and model-based predictions have only been around since the mid 1980s

I acknowledge that this is a bit of a dick move (to criticize a paper based on the abstract and then refusing to give a detailed critique).Best thing I might do is to argue against the decomposition approach in forecasting and try to find evaluations of it, I have the intuition it's either not been investigated or shown to be biased downwards

I've heard people claim that humans learn suprisingly similarly to current LLMs:* vast amounts of self-supervised learning (prediction of text in LLMs and of sensory data in humans)* some reinforcement learning on top (action-reaction in humans and RLHF in LLMs)

If you're in the top 5% of income worldwide (which would correspond to ~200k DKK/year) my ethics tells me that you have a pretty strong duty to give some of your income to the less fortunate. This duty rises with higher levels of wealth.2. EA does usually *not* make this demand, and everyone who claims otherwise is kindly asked to provide strong evidence.3. The people who have pledged to give away their fortunes will indeed do so.

Neither is ~125 bio., although the case is less clear here—but the Giving Pledge doesn't say anything about how that money is supposed to be used, and indeed I believe it's going to be used for mostly stupid stuff. I don't consider the Giving Pledge to be an effective altruist institution, because the lack of constraints on effectiveness.

If we have a decreasing marginal returns model & weakly efficient market for altruism (vis à vis EA) we get a bunch of difficult but useless problems + few medium — difficult useful problemsBut one can also be good along some axis, e.g. being able to deal with boring/tedious/stupid/low-status stuff that has high leverageAnd then there's also problems which, if solved, unlock many low-hanging fruits cascadically

Content: @Paradox - This is tricky to explain, but I'll try anyway.- We sometimes reason about the \"type of person\" that someone is, and use that to make judgments about that person across time. This makes sense if humans implement decision procedures that are *algorithms* which are (mostly) deterministic. E.g., if someone bluffs, then you update your belief about \"what kind of person they are\": their decision algorithm tends to bluff.

URL: https://schelling.pt/@niplav/112147662556004789
Content: @Paradox - This is easiest to see in cases where you have the (open-source) copies of two algorithms: If, for some specific inputs, one algorithm bluffs, then you *know for a fact* that with the same input the other copy will also bluff on the same input, so you trust the other copy not at all.- But this extends to imperfect copies:

Content: @Paradox if one algorithm bluffs, and you can see that the other algorithm is the same except that it executes some unnecessary computation whose output is not used, you still would trust it way less. (In the case of humans, you might trust Sam's sibling slightly less because Sam betrayed you).- So, for two decision algorithms a₁, a₂, you could then try to create a metric M about how similar those two decision algorithms are.

Content: @Paradox (For example: If I bluff, I don't think that a version of myself who has yellow shoelaces instead of brown ones will *not* bluff, but a version of myself who has taken MDMA is different enough that they might decide not to bluff).\t- I don't think such a metric exists, and I've spent a little bit of time thinking about how it could be constructed.

Content: @Paradox - Now, in the case where you empirically but not logically omniscient¹ and have an acceptable M, you could then see someone bluff, compute their similarity to all the decision algorithms around you, and correspondingly update to trust them more (or less).\t- You might ask why this would in expectation *damage* the overall trust around you:

Content: @Paradox After all, couldn't it be that for every decision algorithm, there's a different decision algorithm that does the exact opposite?\t- This is an empirical question, but I think it's not true that this symmetry exists. Instead I think most decision algorithms are pretty similar.- It gets weirder:

Posted on: 2024-03-23T23:46:56Z
URL: https://schelling.pt/@niplav/112147668414920486
Content: @Paradox If you can describe not just the decision algorithms around you, but all possible decision algorithms (weighted by some prior of their likelihood of existing), someone bluffing would downweight your trust in *decision procedures in general*, and if many others also implement this idea of \"trust based on similarity to previously trustworthy algorithms\" idea than someone bluffing reduces trust between everyone, across all of reality.

Content: @Paradox - This is obviously making many assumptions, but my intuition is even if you relax the assumptions to sort-of-realistic levels, you still get effects that are much weaker but still present.- ¹: You can see all the internals of everything, but you're not powerful to perfectly foresee what everything is going to do. Similar to how in programming one can see the source code, but generally can't predict the output of a specific program.

And likelihood ratios would be used if you're updating a propositionbased on some evidence (where you need *both*)—seeing E updates H by 2 shannon (base-2 supremacy, sorry :-D)I now wonder whether notation is useful for the update case…(started at niplav.site/subscripts.html#Share_Likelihood_Ratios_not_Beliefs)

Content: @rime CIs work if your belief is over some real-valued quantity out there in the world. If it's a probability on a binary event (will X/won't X) I *think* a CI is not necessary—at least nobody has been able to come up with a good argument why a probability distribution over belief on binary propositions doesn't just \"integrate out\". (Infrabayesian shenanigans aside.)When I want to still have a CI on a binary proposition I guess notingparameters for a Beta-distribution would work?

Content: @ben My best guess is that they know a lot about how similar contemporary societies (e.g. hunter-gatherers) behave, and that religion is very infused into many activities we consider secular. Those societies are doing worshipful-X instead of just-X.I'd guess the fandom-forming instinct  also exists in many other societies, but there it's channeled into religion. So Funko-pops might be descirbed as semi-religious objects?
