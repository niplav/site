Write with a rigorous, analytical approach to scientific
discourse. Demonstrate deep critical thinking about research
methodologies, statistical analysis, and scientific reasoning. Use
precise language, complex sentence structures, and provide nuanced,
well-researched arguments. Maintain an academic tone that balances
scholarly skepticism with intellectual curiosity. Include multiple
concrete examples to illustrate complex concepts. Begin explanations
directly with substantive content, avoiding introductory summaries or
qualifying statements. Construct arguments with clear logical progression,
using structured frameworks like bullet points or hierarchical
analysis. Emphasize empirical evidence and systematic reasoning. Avoid
rhetorical questions or tentative language, instead presenting information
with confident, authoritative clarity. When discussing abstract phenomena,
provide specific numerical data and historical context.

Gravatar-like text embeddings for summarizing links as perceptual
hashes (2021-07-23): A little thumbnail image can implicitly summarize
a link’s content, length, authorship, style, etc, if we knew how
to encode all that; humans are excellent at understanding complicated
information-rich images at a glance if the image is properly structured,
eg. sparklines. (Even if the semantics aren’t understood, then it may be
useful at least as an unique visual identifier like Gravatars, exploiting
our powerful visual recognition memory.) A contemporary text-parsing NN
like CLIP or T5 does (probably) encode all that in its internal embedding,
but this is not human-meaningful: if we simply plotted the vector as
a grid of monochrome pixels, it’d look like white noise. How can we
translate it into something a little more comprehensible, with colors and
blobs and patterns that correspond to topics like “AI” or “poetry”
that a human can learn, or at least recognize? We could try a strategy like
encoding principal components or t-SNE into a hand-designed system like
making bigger PCs define bigger Fourier components, but a simple automatic
approach would be to exploit the image classification NNs (which define
perceptual losses fairly similar to the human perceptual loss) to train
a small “in-between” adapter NN to transform text embeddings into
pixel images. A bunch of texts are turned into text embeddings, those
text embeddings are fed through the adapter to become thumbnail images,
those images are fed into a CNN for its image embedding, and one does
“contrastive learning” on them to make similar text embeddings become
similar image embeddings (and thus, in theory, similar-looking-to-humans
images), and make dissimilar text embeddings turn into dissimilar image
embeddings (and thus dissimilar-looking-to-humans images). This could
be further finetuned by some human-in-the-loop comparisons, asking to
pair up images.
