Discord Servers for Textbooks
==============================

Inspired by [this shortform
post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DJk86FE29ad4vr5e9/riceissa-s-shortform?commentId=W49udPvKRZB4B3snR),
I decided to collect a list of discord servers dedicated to textbooks.

* [Naive Set Theory (Halmos 1960)](https://discord.gg/sApjeGjdvx)
* [Analysis I (Tao 2016)](https://discord.gg/Jy4HZtP9pt)
