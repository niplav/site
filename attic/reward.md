> __I critique a recent prize from the Effective Altruism movement for
being misguided, offer some alternatives, and then proceed to discuss
the general downfall of epistemic infrastructure on the internet.__

Reward Long Content
====================

Recently, the Ideas Project
[announced](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xapRLBTpMYokrpd9q)
a [$500,000 prize](https://effectiveideas.org/) for
new blogs.

The prize will award an up to $100,000 prize each to the five best recent
blogs, in order to encourage the discussions around effective altruism
and related topics. Blogs need to be public, generally concerned with
effective altruism and longtermism, and should have been started within
the last 12 months.

I believe that this prize is flawed in some subtle and not-so-subtle
ways, which I first lay out, and then propose some alternative prizes
which solve some of the underlying issues.

Critique
---------

> ‘Blog posts’ might be the answer. But I have read
blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph
of the hare over the tortoise. They are meant to be read
by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and
are [quickly](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html)
⁠[abandoned](https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2009-arnold-bloggingstatisticsanddemographics.html)—and
perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that
sad? Isn’t it a terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand,
the best blogs always seem to be building something: they are rough
drafts—works in progress[¹⁵](https://www.gwern.net/About#fn15). So
I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen
content”, what would constitute Long Content as opposed to the
existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now sort
of way?[¹⁶](https://www.gwern.net/About#fn16)

*— [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/), [“About This Website”](https://www.gwern.net/About), 2021*

### Blogs Are Short Content

Except for rare exceptions ([Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com)
being the most notable one), blogs usually don't provide much
long-term value—who cares enough to read the whole archive of a
blog, unless the author is exceptionally skilled? Even in the case
of Scott Alexander, additional effort had to be made to [curate
the best posts](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/) and order
them by topic, something still sorely missing for blogs like [Overcoming
Bias](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QaDwBio8MLqRvTREH/usd10k-bounty-read-and-compile-robin-hanson-s-best-posts)
and [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/) or
[econlog](https://www.econlib.org/econlog/). How much value is provided
by reading the whole Marginal Revolution archives or all posts Robin
Hanson has ever written? A lot, probably, but with extremely low
value per post (compare to a post by Gwern, such as the one on [spaced
repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition)—comprehensive,
up-to-date, all in one place; built up over *10 years*). I should know,
I started reading the Marginal Revolution archives and quickly abandoned
the endeavour, I persisted a bit longer with Overcoming Bias, reading
at least all posts from 2006 and half of the posts from 2007.

Additionally, blogs fall prey to [bit rot](), in which facts fall out
of date, replication crises happen, new relevant ideas are discovered,
better citations become available &c; they also incentivize a focus
on new posts (most blogs show posts chronologically by default,
burying old ones in hard-to-navigate archives or with obscure tagging
systems). (Similar with software projects: unmaintained software is worth
less and less over time, especially when it is far down the technology
stack; the shiny new JavaScript framework is the most popular, even if
[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) would do the trick ust
as well).

What advantage, if any, do blogs have over other media? Books can be (and
usually are) far more comprehensive and high-status, instant messaging
and social media are more engaging, but move from one fashionable topic
onto another, and imageboards—well, we [don't talk about imageboards
here](ihttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet). Blogs
(or, in the best case, [sites](https://www.gleech.org/sites)), allow for
content to be accumulated slowly, and still stay up to date, connecting
a larger network of ideas from a single person (in ways that wikis
usually don't).

As with software projects, the first 80% of the work is finding the idea
and doing the work to have a basic prototype, the second 80% are writing
clearer explanations with images, citing the claims, updating the text
with new facts or arguments after they come out, and perhaps completely
rewriting it after it has turned out to be wrong.

### Did __Anybody__ *Think* About The Incentives?

We can then look at the prize from another lens: Which [algorithms'
measures](zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/08/measure/) does this prize
increase? Surely not the one of people who are willing to put in a decade
into a post about spaced repetition, since one of the requirements is
that the blog should have been started at most 12 months ago (‽),
so the algorithms you incentivize is not “puts a lot of effort into a
blog”, but “puts a lot of effort into a blog as long as there is a
juicy prize at the finish line”. (The website states that only blogs
started "within the last 12 months" are eligible for the prize—does
that refer to the 12 months before the announcement of the prize, or
the date at which the prize is given out?)

Of the blogs that will win the prizes, how many of them will persist
*after* the prize is given out? Not many, I reckon.<!--TODO: make
predictionbook predictions about this-->

Rewarding this kind of unmaintained one-shot content creates not epistemic
infrastructure (posts that come to fruition slowly, that potentially
will still be read in five years), but epistemic fireworks (or, in the
best case, epistemic tinder that sparks discussions).

### Long-Term Prizes for New Blogs

This would be okay if it were a prize for blogs about current event or
news, but the website states that the blogs in question should "explore
themes related to effective altruism and longtermism" and that the
Effective Ideas team has "a particular interest in iconic blog posts
that stand the test of time."

That, of course, makes perfect sense: You'd obviously like to exclude
anyone who has put any real effort into their blog in the past, and
prevent any possible evidence for which blogs and their posts actually
stand the test of time. After all, there's nobody around who has already
shown some capability for working on things for a long time, right⸮

DID THEY NOT SEE THE IRONY OF PUTTING OUT A PRIZE LOOKING FOR BLOGS
FOCUSED ON LONGERMISM WITH POSTS THAT STAND THE TEST OF TIME, BUT EXCLUDE
ANY BLOG OLDER THAN 12 MONTHS? AM I GOING CRAZY?

### Examples: “A Few Of Our Bloggers” Sections

Luckily, they include some blogs in the "A Few of Our Bloggers" section, so I can take a look at how well they have fared so far with regards to producing long-term content.

(If you are one of those bloggers, please don't take this as an
indictment against your blogging abilities—but I'd like to do a
case study. I'd be delighted if you proved me wrong :-)). For the
time being, this will unfortunately be limited to collecting few
datapoints (number of posts, date of last post, length of post) and
rough impressions (in the long term, I plan to add all those posts to
[my collection](https://niplav.github.io/texts_list.html)).

* [Ziggurat](https://ziggurat.substack.com/)
	* 3 posts (one of them an announcement post), decent length, last post April 7th 2022
	* Impression: Good potential, especially with the recent update.
* [Bridget Williams](https://www.bridgetwilliams.blog/)
	* 2 posts, decent length, last post March 26th 2022
	* Impression: Looks nice, probably a bit more in-depth than the average blog. Might become something.
* [The Take Machine](https://thetakemachine.substack.com/p/coming-soon?showWelcome=true&s=r)
	* 1 announcement post, quite short, last post March 7th 2022
	* Impression: This is not yet a blog, so I do not understand why you would link it in a "our bloggers" section.
* [Sam Enright](https://samenright.com/)/[The Fitzwilliam](https://www.thefitzwilliam.com/)
	* 36 posts/8 posts, appreciable length, last post on April 6th 2022
	* Impression: Now *this* is the kind of stuff that gets me excited. Sam, have you considered writing a [site](https://www.gleech.org/sites), not a a blog or a newsletter? Your book reviews would look [very good](https://gwern.net/reviews/Books) on one page ;-). Verdict: Excellent.
* [Heloise Investigates](https://heloiseinvestigates.substack.com/p/coming-soon?showWelcome=true&s=r)
	* 1 announcement post, very short, posted February 15th
	* Impression: Nothing here, similar to The Take Machine. Verdict: [REDACTED]
* [Basil Halperin](https://basilhalperin.com/essays.html)
	* 15 posts, quite long, last post March 31st 2022
	* Impression: I really like this blog: the first post is from 2013 (showing that the author is persistent, even if they're a slow writer, but who am I to call that a vice!), the author *wants* to write a long site but doesn't know it yet (seriously, look at the [best essays](https://basilhalperin.com/essays/best-essays.html) page: add the other 6 posts to that, and it would work great as a landing page for the blog.) Verdict: We could be friends :-)
* [Hands and Cities](https://handsandcities.com/)
	* 46 posts, some of them extraordinarily long (I've been procrastinating on reading [On Infinite Ethics](https://handsandcities.com/2022/01/30/on-infinite-ethics/) for quite a while now), last post March 24th 2022
	* Impression: Outstanding (and *a bit* depressing): The posts are more solid than anything I've ever written, on very interesting topics, with quotes from relevant poetry: This could be turned into a long site in a whim. Also an excellent illustration for why chronological archives often don't make sense: There's no reason why [this post](https://handsandcities.com/2021/06/21/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values/) is deprioritised in the list of posts compared to [this post](https://handsandcities.com/2022/02/18/simulation-arguments/). However, I suspect that these posts will not be updated over time (:-/), which will slowly make them less useful (although this is less of a problem for [philosophy than for other disciplines](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NCzfvp7jmbouodsRP/integrating-the-lindy-effect))—in ten years someone might stumble upon [Can you control the past](https://handsandcities.com/2021/08/27/can-you-control-the-past/) and start scrolling, fascinatedly, an explorer in the ruins of a great ancient civilization.

Verdict: two webpages that aren't actually blogs, two young (but
potentially promising) blogs with few posts, two medium-age blogs that
have *a lot* of content (to the degree that I fear the authors might burn
out or get disillusioned from the endeavour), and a very cute & old site.

Counter-Arguments
------------------

I imagine the organizers of the Effective Ideas blog prize have several
objections, here's two I can anticipate:

### There's Not That Many Longtermist Blogs Around

The prize exists explicitely to encourage new & young writers, so
I imagine the organizers perceive a current lack of blogs about
longtermism and effective altruism (and related areas).

There certainly is no Marginal Revolution of effective altruism, and not
as many people comment on posts on the EA forum as on ACX open threads.

#### Counter-counter-argument

Is that true? To be honest, I don't quite know: I recognize ~all blogs on
[this page](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/ea-blogs), and most
on [this blogroll](https://eablogs.net/), but I would be a lying lier
telling dirty lies if I said I'd read any non-negligible fraction of
their posts. But I looking over those lists, I don't get the impression
that there's a dearth of blogs about effective altruism, but rather a
lack of discoverability or aggregation (why doesn't everyone of those
post their texts to the EA forum?).

This is relevant: If there were very few EA blogs around, then it would
make sense to incentivize the creation of new ones. If many old and
semi-regularly updated EA blogs existed, but if they were just limited
by funding or time, it would make sense to incentivize those blogs to
increase their output (or reward them for their past contributions),
and encourage them to better curate their content.

### Blogs are for Discourse

> Further, we think EA needs more strong writers who can share key ideas
in prestigious and popular venues — to persuade people to work on
the most pressing issues of our time and to advance our thinking about
them. We want to incentivize EAs to develop those skills.

*— [Nick Whitaker](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nick-whitaker-1), [“We're announcing a $100,000 blog prize”](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xapRLBTpMYokrpd9q/we-re-announcing-a-usd100-000-blog-prize), 2022*

The goal of a blog, really, is not to produce really viable long-term
content—it's often just about The Discourse™: Getting certain ideas
into public perception, making the EA perspective a more acceptable
stance in public perception. We want more people to at least *know* about
effective altruism, and most people don't actually read a [180 page about
iterated embryo selection](https://gwern.net/Embryo-selection)—a short
blog post is much more likely to be actually consumed by anyone (many
people I've talked to tell me they've never finished a Gwern post—sad,
of course, but understandable).

#### Counter-counter-argument

> Blogging peaked in 2009; I was there, just.

*— [Gavin Leech](https://www.gleech.org/), [“Blogging is dead, long live sites”](https://www.gleech.org/sites), 2020*

But then, blogs occupy an uncomfortable spot in the informational
ecosystem: The days of glory for blogging are unfortunately over, The
Discourse™ is happening on social media now, in Twitter threads and
Discord messages. All the substacks in the world will not change that
if you want to be plugged in, you might want to make YouTube videos
about effective altruism instead. (Sorry, the era of BoingBoing is not
coming back).

Alternatively, I could see an [EA
newspaper](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iaSmu3t3QKTfkyQqZ/the-altruist-proposal-for-an-ea-newspaper)
as a good idea: having an institutionalized content & Discourse-producing
machine à la [Works in Progress](https://www.worksinprogress.co/)
or [Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/) will reach a
different kind of people who demand the air of respectability
of a newspaper—after all, [blogs are not *exactly*
high-status](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/blogging-doubts.html)
(perhaps this perceived lack of status is why I am so enthusiastic about
long sites: they just feel *classier*).

<!--
Theory
-------

### The Value of Maintenance

### Individual Wikis Don't Work, but Wikipedia Does

Two reasons:

1. People want to participate in vibrant communities → network effects
2. People often have overlapping interests, but the trivial inconvenience of signing up for several wikis prevents them from participating in any more specialized ones

See also [Gwern 2012](https://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia And Other Wikis.html).

### Discourse on Blogs is Probably Dead

#### Discourse on Twitter Lives On

### Why Don't People Care About Their Content?

#### "Start Here" Pages

#### Properties of Good Curations

#### Long Site Wishlist

* John Swentworth
* Stuart Armstrong
* Tetraspace
* Romeo Stevens
* Zack M. Davis
* JhanicManifold
* Donald Knuth
* Vanessa Kosoy
* Anders Sandberg
	* Although this might be remedied by his new book (if it *ever* comes out)

Suggestions for Improvement
----------------------------

Since I obviously have opinions about blogs, but don't want to *just*
criticize other people's hard work, here are some suggested improvements
I believe would be quite beneficial.

### Small Changes

On the less invasive side, I can propose one small improvement:

#### Drop the Age Limit

The 12 month age limit in the current prize makes little sense: If
someone has been producing valuable content for a long time, they will
probably [continue doing so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Effect)
for quite a while. The current prize is unfairly excluding past effort.

### Alternative Prizes

There's also more experimental structures available: Don't
give out prizes; instead perform credit assignment for past work. [Zack M.
Davis](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2017/03/friends-can-change-the-world-or-request-for-social-technology-credit-assignment-rituals/)
outlines the idea in a personal context, transferring it to an
organizational one should be *reasonably* easy:

> So, I had an idea. You know how some people say we
should [fund the solutions to problems with after-the-fact
prizes](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/01/be-a-charity-angel.html),
rather than picking a team in advance that we think might solve the
problem and funding them? What if ... you did something like that,
but on a much smaller scale? A personal scale.
>
> Like, suppose you've just successfully navigated a major personal
life crisis that could have gone much worse if it weren't for some
of the people in your life (both thanks to direct help they provided
during the crisis, and things you learned from them that made you the
sort of person that could navigate the crisis successfully). These
people don't and shouldn't expect a reward (that's what friends
are for) ... but maybe you could reward them anyway (with a special
emphasis on people who helped you in low-status ways that you didn't
understand at the time) in some sort of public ritual, to make them more
powerful and incentivize others to emulate them, thereby increasing the
[measure](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/08/measure/) of algorithms
that result in humans successfully navigating major personal life crises.
>
> It might look something like this—  
>
> • If you have some spare money lying around, set aside some of it for
rewarding the people you want to reward. If you don't have any spare
money lying around, this ritual will be less effective! Maybe you should
fix that!  
> • Decide how much of the money you want to use to reward each of the
people you want to reward.  
>
> (Note: giving away something as powerful as money carries risks of
breeding dependence and resentment if such gifts come to be expected! If
people know that you've been going through a crisis and anyone so much
as hints that they think they deserve an award, that person is missing
the point and therefore does not deserve an award.)
>
> • Privately go to each of the people, explain all this, and give them
the amount of money you decided to give them. Make it very clear that this
is a special unilateral one-time award made for decision-theoretic reasons
and that it's very important that they accept it in the service of your
mutual [coherent extrapolated volition](https://arbital.com/p/cev/) in
accordance with the Bayes-structure of the universe. Refuse to accept
words of thanks (it's not about you; it's not about me; it's about
credit-assignment). If they try to refuse the money, explain that you
will literally burn that much money in paper currency if they don't take
it. (Shredding instead of burning is also acceptable.)  
> • Ask if they'd like to be publicly named and praised as having received
an award as part of the credit-assignment ritual. (Remember that it's
quite possible and understandable and good that they might want to accept
the money, but not be publicly praised by you. After all, if you're the
sort of person who is considering actually doing this, you're probably
kind of weird! Maybe people don't want to be associated with you!)  
> • To complete the ritual, publish a blog post naming the people and
the the awards they received. People who prefered not to be named should
be credited as Anonymous Friend A, B, C, &c. Also list the amount of
money you burned or shredded if anyone foolishly rejected their award
in defiance of the Bayes-structure of the universe. Do not explain the
nature of the crisis or how the named people helped you. (You might want
to tell the story in a different post, but that's not part of the ritual,
which is about credit-assignment.)  

*— [Zack M. Davis](http://zackmdavis.net), [“"Friends Can Change the World"; Or, Request for Social Technology: Credit-Assignment Rituals”](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2017/03/friends-can-change-the-world-or-request-for-social-technology-credit-assignment-rituals/), 2017*

#### The Outstanding Wikipedians Prize

Look at the Wikipedia pages for EA-relevant topics, and find the
contributors who have participated most in the creation of those pages,
contact them and grant them after-the-fact prizes for their efforts.

The advantage is clear: Wikipedia is not going away, and the go-to
resource for ~everybody on a new topic is the Wikipedia page. 10 minor
edits to Wikipedia might outweigh a year of blogging in terms of eyeballs
and social utility.<!--TODO: make fermi estimate here-->

#### The Gwern Prize

Instead of rewarding blogs, look explicitely for sites with long
content, the more long-term, the better (ideally complete with [Wikipedia
contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gwern)
and [archiving & tagging
papers](https://www.gwern.net/Search#post-finding) and [open-source
contributions](https://www.gwern.net/Links#coding-contributions)
and [predictions](predictionbook.com/users/gwern) and [URL
archiving](https://www.gwern.net/Archiving-URLs)), if they don't have
sufficient funding, offer to fund them completely for a year. Make online
conscientiousness be __worth it__.

Conclusion
-----------

I hope I have made a true case for why the Effective Ideas prize is
currently misguided, and perhaps even suggested some pontential avenues
for improvement.

> I strongly agree with you, and would add that long content like Gwern's (or [Essays on Reducing Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org/) or [PredictionBook](https://predictionbook.com/) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) etc.) are important as *epistemic infrastructure*: they have the added value of constant maintenance, which allows them to achieve depth and scope that is usually not found in blogs. I think this kind of maintenance is *really* *__really__* important, especially when considering long-term content.

(Why don't people care more about their content when they put so much effort intro producing it‽).

> I find it ironic that the FTX *Long Term Future Fund* is giving out a price to a medium that is so often so ephemeral, so much not long-term, as blogs (what value can I gain from reading the whole archive of [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/)? A lot, probably, but extremely little value per post, I'm likely better off reading Wikipedia.). What's next? The $10k price for the best discord message about longtermism? The best tweet?

* AllAmericanBreafast's comment: `https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xapRLBTpMYokrpd9q/we-re-announcing-a-usd100-000-blog-prize?commentId=LbqwM6kFhCT7aQWgC`

> Does this prize draw a distinction between a website versus a blog? As an example of something that's more "website" than "blog", think of Gwern's website or imagine a scaled-down individually-run version of 80,000 Hours .

> Why websites?

> I. Emphasis on structure

> The reason I ask is that it seems to me that there are many benefits to creating content that's a little more formal and a little more data-oriented. Blogs tend to treat individual posts as one-offs, even if they're arranged into a sequence. By contrast, websites can break local arguments off into chunks, without requiring that each one be individually fascinating.

> II. Emphasis on tight, interconnected argument across posts

> For example, I've appreciated (and disagreed with) 80k's writings on researcher productivity power laws. Although I have written quite a few reviews of LW blog posts for the annual review, I don't really perceive most blog posts there as making tight, specific arguments about particular topics. They are more about exploring a set of ideas than arguing for a specific conclusion. This is OK, but it means that it's hard to really falsify them. By contrast, it feels potentially productive to do an epistemic spot check or counterargument against an 80k article, or, say, GiveWell analysis.

> III. Timelessness

> Blog posts seem to be about setting a conversational agenda, outlining a rough heuristic, or sometimes about assigning a label to a widely useful framework (i.e. Elizabeth's "epistemic legibility"). There's an immediacy to them that is also ephemeral. By contrast, when I read a website, I am usually there for my own purposes, and am interested in scrutinizing in a relatively timeless argument itself, rather than in participating in a conversation. Since the maintainers of the website are generally, at least in theory, equally invested in the quality of the entire website, rather than in steering the conversation the latest post, it feels potentially productive to contact them with alternative views.

> IV. Potential to scale

> In addition, websites don't have the same expectation of a single authorial voice that a blog has. If I was running a website, and received a cogent rebuttal of one of my articles, then I could potentially, with the author's permission, host it with their byline. Scott's done that for his reader-sourced essay contests and book reviews. But there's still a sense that he's giving these authors a spotlight, rather than taking some sort of personal responsibility for the quality of their offerings. And although some blogs have more than one writer, websites are focused on a theme rather than a personal, and seem to have greater potential to scale up the writing team if it proves useful.

> Why not websites?

> One major advantage of blogs over websites is that blogs do a great job of starting a conversation. They serve a similar function to a daily newspaper. This stands in contrast to a website like 80,000 Hours. If they update their web pages or add new articles, I don't expect that this will draw immediate, concentrated focus in the way that a new post on somebody's blog will.

> Another is that blogs are convenient for the author to start. No need to buy a domain name or think in any sort of depth about how to structure the website overall. You can just write down whatever's on your mind on a given day and hit "publish." One reason potentially to exclude website-building from this contest would be to ensure that you want to send a message that this activity, specifically, is what you're interested in. But it seems more like you're trying to foster information-generating talent than to ensure that talent is expressed in a certain form.

> It may look like this argument is weaker because it's only two paragraphs long. But I think that the ability to set the daily conversation is a form of immense power. I think the daily drip of content does more to create a sense of personal identity than any website ever can. If the goal is to shape the conversation, rather than to provide information and arguments, I think a blog (or its scaled-up version, the newspaper and magazine) is the right choice.

> Who cares?

> People can do whatever they want with blogs and websites. But I think there's value in coming to some kind of tentative model for what our common goals are, and how our production of content contributes to those goals. "Best blogs" implies "best for some purpose," and suggests that the prizerunners have at least some notion of a strategic goal here.

> Not only do I think that the purposes of websites vs. blogs is an interesting topic in its own right, but I also think that making the prizerunner's intuitions about what our goals should be is valuable both for potential writers and as a form of transparency for this community. I don't demand that transparency (such calls for transparency are often framed as a demand). I am simply inviting it!

Text of the post:

> We want to encourage a broader, public conversation around effective altruism and longtermism. To that end, we’re offering up to 5 awards of $100,000 each for the best new and recent blogs. We’re also making grants to promising young writers in the community.

> You can learn more about the project and get on our radar here.
> Why does this matter?

> Top-of-funnel community growth in EA is slower than it could and should be. At the same time, EA is relatively underrepresented in intellectual discourse compared to newer and smaller movements like Progress Studies. EA is producing a ton of thoughtful writing, but the majority takes place in internal discussions and private documents. For some discussions, this would be the only sensible way to have them. But having other discussions in public should help to raise the salience of EA in the broader discourse and bring more people in. It could also help spark new ideas.

 > Further, we think EA needs more strong writers who can share key ideas in prestigious and popular venues — to persuade people to work on the most pressing issues of our time and to advance our thinking about them. We want to incentivize EAs to develop those skills.
> What’s the plan?

> We want to jumpstart these ambitions with the Blog Prize. Over the course of 2022, we want to find the very best new blogs exploring themes related to effective altruism and longtermism. Up to 5 winning bloggers will receive a prize of $100,000 each. (We were inspired by Tyler Cowen’s “Liberalism 2.0” blog prize). You can read more about our rules and guidelines on our website.

> The judging panel for the blog prize is me (Nick Whitaker), Leopold Aschenbrenner, Avital Balwit, and Fin Moorhouse. Most blogs will be considered via our self-nomination form, but please feel free to send us recommendations.
> What next?

> We hope this can be a first step towards a more ambitious effort to support an ecosystem of public-facing writing for EA and longtermism. We believe that EA blogs could soon make up a major part of the general blogosphere, finding audiences (and potential EAs) we wouldn’t have found otherwise. Hopefully, we will also inspire the writing of foundational blog posts and posts that evolve into great projects.

> To help potential bloggers, we’ve compiled a “How to start a blog” guide. We’re also offering mentorship on writing and editorial strategy to bloggers amid our private Slack community of bloggers. Self-nominate your blog on our website if you’d like to join. We have fostered a lively community for discussion, cross-promotion, and peer-to-peer feedback. Eventually, we hope to offer bloggers seminars from established EA writers.

> While this is our first big announcement, stay tuned for future plans and follow ongoing efforts from Effective Ideas to build and foster a written media ecosystem for EA. Watch this space.

> This project is supported by FTX Future Fund and Longview Philanthropy.
