Life Improvements in 2030
===========================

### Disavowal

I now disavow this text. Most of it diverges strongly from the style of
[Applied Divinity Studies'](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2030/) or
[Gwern's original post](https://www.gwern.net/Improvements), focussing
way too much on big developments and not enough on small-scale noticeable
changes.

-----------------

> Noooooo, this is boring ;-). Let's *actually* speculate
about (not so ordinary) life-improvements from a [cozy
future](https://nintil.com/cozy-futurism "Cozy Futurism").

These are not predictions. Predictions would require confidence intervals
or probability distributions, these are **speculations** and *mostly
fiction*. I also expect to not endorse ~3/4 of these after thinking about
them for a couple more hours (I don't endorse some of these right now,
and think this list is too optimistic overall). If you want to have
an accurate view of the future, the joint distribution of community
predictions on [Metaculus](https://metaculus.com) is a better start.

Things That Have Gone Well
---------------------------

*	After 6 years of hard work, [recommender systems are now mostly
	aligned with human values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10939v1),
	but much much more powerful than those of 2021. This has
	resulted in people spending around half as much time on
	their devices, but being much more agentic & fulfilled. The
	creation/commenting/lurking ratio isn't 1:10:100 anymore, but
	rather somewhere around 5:15:80. People have started meeting up
	in person much more (due to good matching algorithms picking out
	people who just really enjoy each other's company, both as friends
	and romantically). However, porn-addiction is still slightly
	worse than it was at the beginning of the 2020s. Luckily, the
	social norms that prevent more predatory companies from making
	people addicted to their devices again are slowly starting to
	apply to porn sites as well.
*	Relatedly, AI generated art has become super good. You think
	[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHxmAsINDk) is good
	orchestral music? Wait till you hear the symphonies written
	by the neural networks—it's quite usual that half of the
	audience is in tears after the concert. The same for movies,
	TV series, paintings, sculpture, opera, …
*	We actually finally really definitely have an Alzheimer's
	cure! Polio is (of course) long eradicated, the last Malaria
	case happened in 2028, and the WHO is preparing to announce
	the end of mosquito borne-diseases altogether. The killer
	that [might be responsible for half of all human deaths
	ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito) is finally defeated.
*	The number of humans worldwide living at or under the extreme
	poverty line is now at 4%, and still falling.
*	In 2029, we first reached an experimental fusion reactor with
	Q>1. It doesn't look like it's going to go into mass production
	*just* yet, but let's give it another ten years, shall we?
*	Clean meat performed *much* better than most people
	expected: The cheapest variants reached price-parity with beef
	in march 2027, with pork in september 2028 and are expected to
	blow chicken out of the water around 2032. In western
	countries, most people have realized that they were [reluctant
	omnivores](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2020/12/04/the-conflicted-omnivore/),
	and with very little fanfare (except from the EA and some animal
	rights communities), factory farming is slowly but steadily
	declining (chicken farmimg will, unfortunately, likely stick
	around until around 2040, and fish agriculture for another ten
	years afterwards).
*	We haven't [engineered
	paradise](https://www.paradise-engineering.com/) yet, but
	through a mix of 5-MeO-DMT, biofeedback and specialized
	techniques, most people can develop the first two or three
	[jhanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Buddhism)
	on a 10-day retreat and call them up in daily life after a
	half-hour sit. Some governments tried to regulate those retreats
	out of existence around 2026, but have mostly given up on it –
	it's hard to stop people from just sitting. This means that with
	a little dedication, most people can reach hedonic independence.
*	Blockchain scalability has been improved so that most
	international financial transactions between individuals are
	done via some cryptocurrency. Governments are still trying to
	find ways how to stop this, but it's looking harder and harder
	by the day (this of course has the negative side-effect that
	anyone can send anyone any amount of money)
*	Battery technology has continued becoming better and better, and
	solar panels have continued becoming more and more efficient. Most
	industrialized countries are at ~40% electricity production
	through solar, most developing countries are at ~50%, most
	third-world countries are at ~25%.
*	Of course, capitalism has run its normal course, and goods are
	slightly cheaper than they were ten years ago, services slightly
	more reliable, processes run slightly more smooth

Things that Didn't Pan out as Hoped
--------------------------------------------

* Self-driving cars are, of course, still 3 years away.
*	Around 2024/2025 there was another craze around molecular
	nanotechnology, following the development of AlphaFold3, but
	completely solving the second 80% of the problem have proven
	more difficult than imagined—distributional shift has shown
	to reduce performance in molecules that have structures vastly
	different from biological ones.
*	Relatedly, it looks like
	longevity escape velocity won't be reached [in
	2036](https://www.longevity.technology/longevity-escape-velocity-by-2035-and-it-will-be-free/)
	– the updated estimates suggest some time around 2060, if nothing
	weird happens. The popularity of cryonics [has been following its
	trend](http://lessdead.com/how-many-humans-will-have-their-brain-preserved-forecasts-and-trends)
	with a slight uptake around 2023, after Elon Musk announced he
	had signed up.
*	Prediction markets have been properly tried (even
	though some hardliners still insist that 5 million
	participants, with over a billion dollars in the biggest
	market, aren't enough), and [found to be too susceptible to
	mass-delusions](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/02/18/election.html)
	even when they're deep, thick and liquid. Nobody really knows
	how to explain why. However, expert forecasting augmented with
	large neural networks works pretty well, and is *very slowly*
	being adopted by slightly more progressive governments.
*	Cancer is still a huge problem, and has displaced cardiovascular
	diseases as the major cause of death.
*	Scaling mostly didn't pan out in the end (I don't actually expect
	this to happen, but it needs to for this to be plausible –
	with proto-AGI, most of this is pretty tame/too cozy)! *Something
	something* causality *something* neural networks didn't become
	modular enough.
*	Carbon-capture technology and geoengineering have been
	politicized, and are likely not going to be implemented in western
	countries. It's very unclear how to deal with the remaining carbon
	in the atmosphere after the switch to renewables has been fully
	finished. At least proper carbon taxes have been implemented in
	most western countries, and around half of all cars are electric.
