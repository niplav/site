About
=====

The site
--------

### Content

This website contains essays on different topics, ranging
from programming over philosophy to discussions of odd social
behavior, as well as translations, transcriptions, music
recordings and programming projects.  It follows the idea of [Long
Content](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content): pages that are
continually getting refined and updated, never quite completely finished,
but approaching stability. This allows for "perpetual drafts", along
with continuous improvement (similar to a wiki, but mainly edited by one
person). Because of this, TODO's are left in the text, making it easier
for me to find them and edit them out, though they may leave the reader
with an unsatisfying feeling of incompleteness.

This is inspired by the idea of Long Content, produced under the motto

> Think Less Wrong, act Long Now and Suck Less.

*– paraphrasing [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/), [“About This Website”](https://www.gwern.net/About), 2019*

For this reason, articles are not published by date,
but rather by category, both to make it easier to read
the content of the site in order (i. e. to ["Start at the
Beginning"](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/))
and to structure it by topic and form, rather than to strive for quick
attention grabbing.

#### Essays

The essays contain mainly new material, both short argument and
collections of links, but also longer descriptions of new ideas or
analyses of concepts where existing descriptions (e.g. on Wikipedia or
other blogs) were deemed incomplete. It is of course not possible to
avoid replicating existing ideas (it is not possible for me to read
anything beyond a slim part of existing texts on a topic before writing
my own ideas down), but it seems likely that the idea will at least
be new to most readers.

Generally I use the rule: Let t be the time it would take to write a
text about the idea I was thinking about. Then the time spent researching
whether the idea exists already should stop take at most `$\frac{t}{2}$`.

#### Translations & Transcriptions

TODO: link to the relevant subsection of https://reducing-suffering.org/ways-writing-valuable/

It seems possible that archiving content has a much bigger impact than
creating new content. Given that I write mostly for self-expression,
it is a small factor in most of what I do, but occasionally I transcribe
or translate texts in order to make them more easily accessible.

The translations are often intertwined with the effort of learning other
languages or exercising language skills that would otherwise be forgotten.
For that reason, they can be of quite low quality, so I'm always grateful
for corrections sent my way.

#### Music Recordings

#### Programming Projects

### Style

The style of writing is mostly formal english. TODO: Find out whether
to use US or british english.

* Titles and headers use the (TODO: information about the exact style) style of capitalization
* MathJax is used only when necessary
* The Oxford comma is not used
* American english spelling instead of british english spelling is used (labor and not labour) (TODO: follow through on this!)
* Code is not syntax-highlighted
* A passive voice is preferred, but I have to get into the flow of writing, so texts may contain that as well. TODO: get rid of "we"?
* No footnotes/endnotes (see https://entirelyuseless.com/2015/07/11/are-hyperlinks-a-bad-idea/)
* Quotes have the following style: `*– [Author Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_Name), [“Chapter” in “Work Name”, p. 1](https://work-name.com), Year*`. If the work is not online, link the wikipedia page.
* For pages, optimal is to give the pagenumber of the quotation in the linked pdf. If it is not available, the page number written at the bottom of the page is used.
* Link to document: typical style
	* for one author: `[Author Year](./title_author_year.pdf)`
	* for two authors: `[Author&Coauthor Year](./title_author_coauthor_year.pdf)`
	* for more than two authors: `[Author et. al Year](./title_author_et_al_year.pdf)`
* The year for a text is usually the best date of the last significant change to the text.
* Link individual chapters from books, not whole books, whole papers are okay.
* Sections every article contains:
	* link back to the index page `[home](./index.md)`
	* metadata on the article, bold&quoted abstract
	* title of the article
	* "External Links"/"See Also" for links to other websites discussing the same (or very similar) ideas
	* "Discussions" for external discussions on the article
* Long numbers written with underscores (for separating thousands/millions etc.)

### Writing Checklist

* Spell checking
* check broken markdown
* broken citations
* "labour" instead of "labor", "behaviour" instead of "behavior"
* links for authors to wikipedia
* capitalization (capitalisation?) of headings
* proselint?
* fixing 404'ed links?

### Organisation

Tags for texts (mainly taken from http://www.gwern.net/About):

* author "author"
* creation date "created"
* [translator "translator"]
* [translation date "translated"]
* [transcriptor "transciptor"]
* [transcription date "transcribed"]
* modification date "modified"
* language: {english, german, french, serbocroatian, esperanto, lojban, ithkuil, toki pona}
* confidence {certain, highly likely, likely, possible, unlikely, highly unlikely, remote, impossible, log, fiction, theory, translation, transcription, emotional, other}
* status {notes, draft, in progress, finished, abandoned}
* importance [1;10]

### Implementation

The website is built writing the articles in Markdown (TODO: link here)
and them compiling them to standard HTML using `markdown_py` (TODO:
link). Mathematical formulae are typeset using MathJax. It only uses
only minimal CSS (highlighting code and quotes, centering the text and
limiting line length) and no JavaScript.
