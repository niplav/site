> __What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of
money, and couldn't spend it maximally altruistically.__

If I Were An Eccentric Trillionaire
=====================================

I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: "If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
disallowing the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course."

The following is a result of this speculation. Many of the ideas might
be of questionable morality; I hope it's clear I would think a bit more
about them if I were to actually put them into practice (which I won't,
since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely to get hold of
it myself anytime soon).

Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source.

Culture
---------

* __Snowball fights__: I remember having *a lot of* fun with snowball fights
during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere outside
since leaving school. People sign up for participating in (moderated)
snowball fights, and are notified on weekends with especially good snow.
Large open grassy fields are rented (e.g. a stadium), and separated
into at least 2 parts, each parts gets a large pile of fresh snow (to
minimize the chance of stones in snowballs). People are encouraged to
bring protective gear to allow for rougher fighting. If one is to allow
for physical encounters, one'd need to group by fitness/size.
* __Buy a small island for disaster preparation__

Language
---------

* __Save dying languages__: There are ~6900 living
languages in the world, but the number of speakers for
languages is heavy-tailed: ~500 of those languages [are nearly
extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages#Discussion),
likely due to very few and elderly native speakers. Extinct languages
are a loss of the cultural heritage of humankind, so just as we want to
save endangered species or artworks from their destruction, it would
be cool to save nearly extinct languages from their demise. This
is not just hypothetical: From 2013 to 2023, [19 languages have
died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_time_of_extinction#21st_century)<!--TODO:
has rate of language death sped up? Read around to figure this out-->. To
do this, we employ linguists to learn each of the the endangered languages
and practice it. 10 linguists per language should be enough, so we
employ 5000 of them at ~\\$50k a year, for 4 years, to spend learning the
language full-time, which yields us expenses of ~\\$1bio. Then say that
we continue employing them part-time for 20 years to continue practicing
until we've found a way to permanently store the languages, for example
by training large language models (text and audio) on those languages;
this would give us (at \\$10k salary a year) another \\$1bio. in expenses,
plus whatever cost the preservation procedure entails.
* __Raise native speakers of an engineered
conlang__: Spurred on by the [Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity),
people have created [several engineered constructed
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Engineered_languages).
Such languages attempt to introduce new paradigms to spoken languages
and aim for extreme properties along one or more axes: emotional
expressivity ([Láadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Láadan)),
complete grammar and lack of syntactic ambiguity
([Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban)), simplicity ([Toki
Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona)), expressivity and semantic
richness ([Ithkuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil))…<br>
We know that people can use a constructed language as
their native tongue, as there are [>1k native Esperanto
speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers) in the
world. But I do not know of any examples of raising a child primarily on a
language engineered to exceed the bounds of natural language, the closest
being [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rewmVNsmz0s). So
it would interesting to pay some new parents (ideally already
both speakers of the engineered language) to raise a child with
that language. The difficulty of achieving this depends on how
difficult the target language is to learn, and [how many speakers there
are](https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1082/how-many-people-speak-esperanto-compared-to-other-planned-languages):
Toki Pona should be easiest (allegedly has ~100 speakers),
followed by Lojban (hard to learn, has ~15 speakers) and Láadan
(perhaps easier to learn, but less developed and there are
negligibly many speakers (and therefore likely none willing to
raise a child)), [Kēlen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kēlen)
would be quite difficult (since there are probably no fluent
speakers, and speakers would need to be trained) and Ithkuil
is probably impossible, as [even the creator can't speak it
fluently](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners).
I don't know what price parents would put on raising one of their
children in primarily the constructed language, which might be in
the highest case several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year:
If we have two children in different families per language, and pick
Toki Pona, Láadan, Lojban and Kēlen, at \$200k per parent and year,
until the child is 18 years old, we pay `$\$200000 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot
18=\$28.8 \text{ mio}$`. We know that children can be bilingual, so the
danger of inability to communicate can basically be excluded—and since
money is not a huge issue, one could offer a ~\$10mio. insurance against
worst-case outcomes. If we assume that worst-case outcomes are possible
but unlikely<sub>5%</sub>, we pay (in expectation) `$4 \cdot 0.05 \cdot \$
10 \text{ mio.}=\$2\text{ mio.}$`, for a total of \$30.8 mio.
* __Philosophically solve language__: Related to raising native speakers
of engineered conlangs, I am not very impressed by the degree of effort
that has gone into trying to philosophically solve language—all
work has been done by hobbyists, without a neat [concentration of
force](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQKstXH8ZMAdN5iqD/concentration-of-force).
We have [John
Wilkin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins) [unnamed
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Towards_a_Real_Character,_and_a_Philosophical_Language)
&_Lojban &
[aUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aUI_\(Constructed_language\))
& Láadan & Ithkuil, but there's never been a *concerted* effort
at exploring the space—we e.g. haven't yet tried to create a
language for [Lullism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullism),
[deleuzian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze)
[post-structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism)
or the insights from the [rationality
community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong).  There are
[reasons to be skeptical](https://gwern.net/language) about the allure
of philosophically powerful languages, and it's not quite clear what
*exactly* would be looked for here, but that's all part of the problem
statement! If we employ 5 philosophers and 5 linguists at \$100k/year for
10 years, we spend \\$10 mio, and at worst we get some very interesting
speculation.

		* This one's pretty ethically questionable
	* Replicate the work at the [semalab](https://semalab.arizona.edu/) that uses ultrasound brain stimulation for meditation enhancement.

		* Plus professionally done sets of flashcards for those textbooks

Metaphilosophy
---------------

* New modes of being
	* What activity-shaped holes are there in our society? How can we find them?
		* Examples:
			* At some point someone must have invented music. That was a pretty big deal! Maybe we're missing a bunch of these kinds of things and don't even notice.
			* Same for meditation.
* Really Out There Stuff Institute (ROTSI)
	* Focus on exotic decision theories, acausal trade, UDASSA, infinite ethics etc. Global priorities research on steroids.
