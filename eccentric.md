> __What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of
money, and couldn't spend it maximally altruistically.__

If I Were An Eccentric Trillionaire
=====================================

I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: “If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
forbidding the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course.”

The following is a result of this speculation in particular. Many of
the ideas might be of questionable ethicality; I hope it's clear I would
think a bit more about them if I were to actually put them into practice
(which I won't, since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely
to get hold of it anytime soon).

Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source.

Culture
---------

* Snowball fights: I remember having *a lot of* fun with snowball fights during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere outside since leaving school.

Language
---------

* Save dying languages
* Raise children bilingual, first language Lojban
* Philosophically Solving Language
	* Via Conlangs
	* We have Loglan & Lojban & Láadan & Ithkuil, but there's never been a *concerted* efffort at this?

Art
----

* A good series set in the SCP Universe
	* Spinoff series set in the antimemetics division
* Hard Takeoff Movie
	* Humans die in the first minute, space megastructure & multiverse-wide cooperation & later ontokinetics shenanigans follow
* Double Crux: The Podcast. Super long (>>10h) discussions between two people trying to resolve a mutual disagreement, with moderation and fact checking help
* A Fictional Ethnography and Anthropology of Native Antarticans
* Beautiful Geometric Objects
	* The platonic solids in physical form, similar to tungsten cubes, but of varying size & material (from a steel icosahedron with a few centimetres vertex length to a granite cube or obsidian dodecahedron twenty metres at each side)—the stuff that would make future people say "they considered themselves a powerful culture"
* Buy the movie rights to House of Leaves to make sure noone can ever make a movie out of it.

Science
--------

* Better Wireheading
	* Achieving reversible (you can remove it and the rat feels/behaves as before) & non-adaptative (no hedonic adaptation happening) & non-addictive (isn't sought after when removed) & safe (doesn't have any serious health consequences) & ability-preserving (cognitive function isn't impaired, and ideally improved) & anti-slippery (when in the state the being doesn't seek more of it) long-term pleasure centric wireheading via extensive experiments on animals, either by direct brain stimulation or novel compounds.
		* This one's pretty ethically questionable
	* Replicate the work at the [semalab](https://semalab.arizona.edu/) that uses ultrasound brain stimulation for meditation enhancement.
* [Breeding Superintelligent Octopuses](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DaFG3GKsBrsAnAERR/save-humanity-breed-sapient-octopuses)
* Cloning Extinct Animals
	* In order: Passenger Pigeons, Thylacines, Dodos, Wooly Mammoths, Neanderthals, John von Neumann…
* Masturbation Research
* Explorables for Causal Inference
* Find drugs that cause short-term memory loss with ideally no side effects (useful for blinding in scientific studies)
* Studying foreveraloners

Metascience
------------

* The Distillation Team
	* A group of people whose sole job it is to talk with smart people whose perfectionism blocks them from writing any of their ideas down and doing it for them
* The Meta-Analysis Team
	* A group of people who, whenever I have a question, do a deep dive into the topic & produce a large & in-depth report on the topic (ideally Gwern-style, but I would be willing to make compromises)
* A roadmap to learn everything
	* A list of textbooks whose order is optimised for having all dependencies covered.
		* Plus professionally done sets of flashcards for those textbooks

Metaphilosophy
---------------

* New modes of being
	* What activity-shaped holes are there in our society? How can we find them?
		* Examples:
			* At some point someone must have invented music. That was a pretty big deal! Maybe we're missing a bunch of these kinds of things and don't even notice.
			* Same for meditation.
* Really Out There Stuff Institute (ROTSI)
	* Focus on exotic decision theories, acausal trade, UDASSA, infinite ethics etc. Global priorities research on steroids.
