> __What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of
money, and couldn't spend it maximally altruistically.__

If I Were An Eccentric Trillionaire
=====================================

I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: "If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
disallowing the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course."

The following is a result of this speculation. Many of the ideas might
be of questionable morality; I hope it's clear I would think a bit more
about them if I were to actually put them into practice (which I won't,
since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely to get hold of
it myself anytime soon).

Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source.

Culture
---------

* __Snowball fights__: I remember having *a lot of* fun with snowball
fights during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere
outside since leaving school. People sign up for participating in
(moderated) snowball fights, and are notified on weekends with especially
good snow. Large open grassy fields (or perhaps even stadiums) are
rented, and separated into at least 2 parts, each parts gets a large pile
of fresh snow (to minimize the chance of stones in snowballs). People are
encouraged to bring protective gear to allow for rougher fighting. If one
is to allow for physical encounters, one'd need to group by fitness/size.
* __Buy a small island__: Since other billionaires are now
[unable](https://qz.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-nauru-court-case-money-laundering-1850662899)
or unwilling to buy a small remote island for eccentric trillionaire
purposes, this duty now falls on us. Owning an island has several
advantages, such as being able to provide shelter during some catastrophic
events and be a base for organizing other eccentric activities. Plus
points if the island owned is a nation state, as one could pass ones
own laws (within the bounds of international agreements, of course).
Let's say we e.g. try to buy [Nauru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru)[^1].
Nauru's GPD is ~\\$135 mio., which at a discount rate of ~5% has a
[net present value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value)
of `$\frac{\$135 \text{ mio.}}{0.05}=\$2.7 \text{ bio.}$`,
which we can round up to \\$3 bio. What if we instead
try to buy Nauru from each Nauruan individually? The [average
GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita#Table)
[per
capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita#Table)
of Nauru seems to be ~\\$12k, but to be conservative we can round that
up to \\$15k. Then the net present value (again at 5%) of each Nauruans
future income is `$\frac{\$15\text{k}}{0.05}=\$300\text{k}$`. There are
11k Nauruans, which results in an expense of
`$\frac{\$3 \cdot 10^5}{\text{person}} \cdot 1.1 \cdot 10^4 \text{ persons}=\$3.3 \cdot 10^9$`.
In both cases, the Nauruans would be giving up a significant amount
of their civil rights, and might want to find new citizenships, to
support them with this one could allocate more money so that the sum
nicely sums up to \\$5bio. So it would be *financially* feasible to
do this, but would it be politically and legally feasible? I don't
know about that, and don't know of any precedent either. [Leopold
II.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium) privately owned
the [Congo Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_free_state),
but I don't think he *bought* it, and instead convinced the other
European states to be allowed to militarily seize it. (Our intentions
are far more benevolent (and probably weirder) than Leopold's).
* __[You Can Do Futarchy Yourself](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself) on Steroids__

Language
---------

* __Save dying languages__: There are ~6900 living
languages in the world, but the number of speakers for
languages is heavy-tailed: ~500 of those languages [are nearly
extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages#Discussion),
likely due to very few and elderly native speakers. Extinct languages
are a loss of the cultural heritage of humankind, so just as we want to
save endangered species or artworks from their destruction, it would
be cool to save nearly extinct languages from their demise. This
is not just hypothetical: From 2013 to 2023, [19 languages have
died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_time_of_extinction#21st_century)<!--TODO:
has rate of language death sped up? Read around to figure this out-->. To
do this, we employ linguists to learn each of the the endangered languages
and practice it. 10 linguists per language should be enough, so we
employ 5000 of them at ~\\$50k a year, for 4 years, to spend learning the
language full-time, which yields us expenses of ~\\$1 bio. Then say that
we continue employing them part-time for 20 years to continue practicing
until we've found a way to permanently store the languages, for example
by training large language models (text and audio) on those languages;
this would give us (at \\$10k salary a year) another \\$1 bio. in expenses,
plus whatever cost the preservation procedure entails.
* __Raise native speakers of an engineered
conlang__: Spurred on by the [Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity),
people have created [several engineered constructed
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Engineered_languages).
Such languages attempt to introduce new paradigms to spoken languages
and aim for extreme properties along one or more axes: emotional
expressivity ([Láadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Láadan)),
complete grammar and lack of syntactic ambiguity
([Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban)), simplicity ([Toki
Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona)), expressivity and semantic
richness ([Ithkuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil))…<br>
We know that people can use a constructed language as
their native tongue, as there are [>1k native Esperanto
speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers) in the
world. But I do not know of any examples of raising a child primarily on a
language engineered to exceed the bounds of natural language, the closest
being [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rewmVNsmz0s). So
it would interesting to pay some new parents (ideally already
both speakers of the engineered language) to raise a child with
that language. The difficulty of achieving this depends on how
difficult the target language is to learn, and [how many speakers there
are](https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1082/how-many-people-speak-esperanto-compared-to-other-planned-languages):
Toki Pona should be easiest (allegedly has ~100 speakers),
followed by Lojban (hard to learn, has ~15 speakers) and Láadan
(perhaps easier to learn, but less developed and there are
negligibly many speakers (and therefore likely none willing to
raise a child)), [Kēlen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kēlen)
would be quite difficult (since there are probably no fluent
speakers, and speakers would need to be trained) and Ithkuil
is probably impossible, as [even the creator can't speak it
fluently](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners).
I don't know what price parents would put on raising one of their
children in primarily the constructed language, which might be in
the highest case several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year:
If we have two children in different families per language, and pick
Toki Pona, Láadan, Lojban and Kēlen, at \$200k per parent and year,
until the child is 18 years old, we pay `$\$200000 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot
18=\$28.8 \text{ mio}$`. We know that children can be bilingual, so the
danger of inability to communicate can basically be excluded—and since
money is not a huge issue, one could offer a ~\$10 mio. insurance against
worst-case outcomes. If we assume that worst-case outcomes are possible
but unlikely<sub>5%</sub>, we pay (in expectation) `$4 \cdot 0.05 \cdot \$
10 \text{ mio.}=\$2\text{ mio.}$`, for a total of \$30.8 mio.
* __Philosophically solve language__: Related to raising native speakers
of engineered conlangs, I am not very impressed by the degree of effort
that has gone into trying to philosophically solve language—all
work has been done by hobbyists, without a neat [concentration of
force](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQKstXH8ZMAdN5iqD/concentration-of-force).
We have [John
Wilkin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins) [unnamed
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Towards_a_Real_Character,_and_a_Philosophical_Language)
& Lojban &
[aUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aUI_\(Constructed_language\))
& Láadan & Ithkuil, but there's never been a *concerted* effort
at exploring the space—we e.g. haven't yet tried to create a
language for [Lullism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullism),
[deleuzian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze)
[post-structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism)
or the insights from the [rationality
community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong). There are
[reasons to be skeptical](https://gwern.net/language) about the allure
of philosophically powerful languages, and it's not quite clear what
*exactly* would be looked for here, but that's all part of the problem
statement! If we employ 5 philosophers and 5 linguists at \$100k/year for
10 years, we spend \\$10 mio, and at worst we get some very interesting
speculation.

Art
----

* __SCP series__: The [SCP Foundation Wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/)
is probably the most successful collaborative fiction writing project of
the internet age (though probably not the most successful collaborative
fiction project ever; any medium-large scale religious mythology has
higher longevity, more detail & more consistency than SCP). It has
inspired [an animated series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9872610/)[^2]
[and](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13484102/)
[some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOZkf4imaM)
[short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MFurJmxNCs)
[films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoCGiSzWIa4), as
well as [several](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54870256)
[books](https://boingboing.net/2021/06/12/graphic-novel-about-one-of-the-most-epic-scp-foundation-entires.html).
However, despite the
[clamorings](https://old.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/14fiss1/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_way_to_adapt_scp/)
[of
the](https://old.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/157mw35/scp_foundation_the_series/)
[community](https://old.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/157mw35/scp_foundation_the_series/),
the [creative commons
license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) used
for the SCP wiki content (CC-BY-SA-3.0) has hindered the development of
a professional adaption—technically using the material for commercial
purposes is possible, but the share-alike property demands that the
produced works be freely copyable and under a license no more restrictive
than the original license. So the production of such a professional
series would be, after all, a public good. But that doesn't concern us,
the eccentric trillionaire: We just want some cool SCP content to watch.
The SCP universe lends itself to an anthology series like [Love,
Death & Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_&_Robots)
or [The Animatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animatrix);
e.g. following [MTF Omega-7 ("Pandora's Box") with
Able](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076-2) (showing the uneasy situation
the Foundation finds itself in, caught between the Scylla of using
SCPs but with potentially disastrous outcomes, and the charybdis of
being crushed and consumed by the anomalous world around it), or [the
Reluctant Dimension Hopper](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-507)
on some of his unfortunate travels, a
[slice-of-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life)-with-a-twist
episode with a member of one of the [Gamers Against
Weed](https://www.scp-wiki.net/gamers-against-weed-dossier),
a [Pythonesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)
sketch on someone (unsuccessfully) trying to explain [SCP
426](https://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-426) to someone else, a short episode
with the content of [Revenants](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/revenants),
a little exploration of the [log of anomalous
items](https://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items) in form
of an introduction to a new foundation researcher… What budget
one would need to be is not quite as clear, on the high end [Game of
Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) commanded a budget
of >\\$600 mio. for 73 episodes, and [The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of
Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power)
has a committed budget of at least \\$1 bio. for 5 seasons. I haven't
been able to find information on the budget of Love, Death & Robots or
The Animatrix. Spending \\$1 bio. on an SCP series is not unthinkable
in this case.
	* __Spinoff with Antimemetics Division__: Of course I can't
	neglect my favorite work of fiction: The novel [There Is No
	Antimemetics Division](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54870256)
	would lend itself well to a one-season spinoff.
* __Discontinuous & Fast AI Takeoff Movie__: Most movies with
artificial intelligence feel pretty provincial to me: Most
of the AI systems in those movies are simply [humans in funny
suits](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/humans-in-funny-suits), at
best they are [not bipedal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/)
or perhaps [distributed over some amount of bipedal
bodies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6292852/),
or perhaps wholly [without a body but very human in
behavior](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/). I do enjoy
movies with [very](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/)
[non-human](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/) aliens—can
we have the same for AIs?  One way to achieve this would to have a
movie about an AI system that crosses a threshold of capabilities
extremely quickly and suddenly. Humans die in the first ~2 minutes
of the movie (less than a couple of days in-movie time), followed by
the AI systems constructing megastructures in space by [deconstructing
planets](./doc/big_picture/fermi/eternity_in_6_hours_sandberg_armstrong_2013.pdf),
sending probes to all reachable galaxies &c. Interactions with
other highly advanced alien civilizations could be shown, including
trade (though hard to convey *that* trade is taking place) and
warfare (much easier to convey: nicer visual effects from [black
hole bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_bomb), induced
supernovae and near-*[c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light)*
projectiles; but perhaps not as likely to happen in reality because
warfare is [negative-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game),
and we should expect advanced agents to avoid negative sum
behavior). Processes within the AI could also be fascinating to
visualize: the creation, pursuit and extermination of [optimization
daemons](https://arbital.com/p/daemons/) and the difficulties of
trying to align future versions (perhaps put on screen as blurry
simulations of successor behavior) should be [interesting to look
at](https://kajsotala.fi/2011/12/ai-thought-process-visualization/). If
we're willing to get *really* weird, one could try to depict [acausal
trade](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/acausal-trade), multiverse-wide
evidential cooperation and later ontokinetics shenanigans—but then one'd
need to launch a research project on how these things could possibly
play out. One difficulty of making this movie: The strategies of such
a system would probably be extremely alien by human standards, and the
resulting movie would be quite conceptual as a result—and by [Vinge's
law](https://arbital.com/p/Vinge_law/) the scriptwriters wouldn't be able
to make it even remotely realistic. But it might be pretty—similar
to [Koyaanisqatsi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/),
maybe using the [Brandenburg
Concertos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concertos)
as music. [Really expensive
movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films)
cost at most ~\\$400 mio., we could easily top that by spending half a
billion on a frivolous nerd project.

[^1]: It's not clear that Nauru is the best choice here. While it probably is the smallest nation state that can conceivably be bought (I don't think there is any realistic (or unrealistic) amount of money for which Vatican City could be acquired), it is not very fertile, and has only limited freshwater reserves, relying mostly on rainwater. The highest point is only 71 metres above sea level, which means that a large part of the island might be at risk of going under water with rising sea levels.
