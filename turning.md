Turning Some Inconsistent Preferences into Consistent Ones
===========================================================

Discrete Case
--------------

### Graphs

### Encoding Inconsistencies

#### Incompleteness

#### Intransitivity

### Resolving Inconsistencies

Continuous Case
----------------

### Vector Fields over Probability Simplices

Vector field over the probability simplex over the options (representing
local preferences over lotteries).

#### Encoding Inconsistencies

##### Incompleteness

##### Intransitivity

##### Discontinuities

Can only exist with incompleteness?

##### Dependence of Irrelevant Alternatives

#### Resolving Inconsistencies

Find mapping from vector field to another that makes the vector field
consistent by minimizing the amount of turning/shrinking the vectors
have to perform.

### Graphons

?

Look into extremal graph theory.
