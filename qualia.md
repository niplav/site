> __[Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) likes
to distinguish between Progress in Bits (new algorithms, network
protocols, user interfaces, social media sites…) and Progress in Atoms
(transportation speed, energy usage, material abundance…). I propose a
third category: Progress in Qualia; and outline factors influencing it.__

Progress in Qualia
===================

It is not clear how one might want to
measure Progress in Qualia: the [necessary
instruments](https://qualiacomputing.com/2020/02/23/qualiascope/ "Qualiascope")
are not quite there yet. Therefore I'm mostly reduced to
speculation, but speculation also has it's place.

I will be trying to find examples of broad
developments that impact many people a little (an aggregative "normally distributed" view), and
qualia in the logarithmic tail that [might out outweigh other types of
qualia](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gtGe8WkeFvqucYLAF/logarithmic-scales-of-pleasure-and-pain-rating-ranking-and "Logarithmic Scales of Pleasure and Pain: Rating, Ranking, and Comparing Peak Experiences Suggest the Existence of Long Tails for Bliss and Suffering")
in importance (an outlier-focused "log-normally distributed" view).

* __Humans__
	* The world economy has been experiencing a huge surge in growth [over the last ~200 years](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia).
		* This has made humanity (and most individual humans)
		much richer, and has had the effect of humanity becoming
		much *larger*: growing from ~1 bio. in 1800 to ~8
		bio. now. That means there's many more human qualia.
		* This has also caused the average lifespan to
		rise from ~25 years to ~70 years, causing many
		more qualia specific to humans of old age relative
		to the qualia of younger people (though this is
		likely tampered by the [subjective speedup of time as one
		ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception#Changes_with_age)).
		The qualia of older people might have a lower
		energy parameter, and the variance in younger
		people is probably higher. If subjective
		time spend in old age is longer, chronic pains
		might weigh more strongly, and we're potentially
		neglecting [large amounts of suffering at the end of
		life](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/)
		(since there is no selection against high [energy
		expenditure](https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/03/are-pain-and-pleasure-equally-energy.html)
		close to death).
		* Individual wealth has been rising, when ~90% of
		people were in extreme poverty in 1800, today only [~10%
		are](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute).
		This has a remarkably small effect on [self-reported
		happiness](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gCDsAj3K5gcZvGgbg/will-faster-economic-growth-make-us-happier-the-relevance-of).
		In the best case I'd guess that happiness is logarithmic
		to material wealth, in a bad case I'd guess that it is
		linear in the beginning and then tapers off, and in the
		worst case I think it's purely positional to the society
		around you.
			* It might be that humans are now much more
			protected from very bad events such as the
			death of a child or long-lasting parasite &
			disease burden, which usually weighs *extremely
			negatively* on the quality of the life of a
			person, and happened far more often in the
			ancestral evolutionary environment.
	* __[Anesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic)
	and [analgesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic)__ are
	huge advances: I can well imagine that getting a limb amputated
	while fully awake (or, slightly better, nearly [black-out
	drunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia#History)) was
	the worst experience of one's life. Most of the development of
	generial anesthesia happened in the late 19th century, e.g. by
	the discovery of chloroform as an anaesthetic by [James Young
	Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Young_Simpson).
	* __Drugs__
		* It seems possible that
		even though we experience [hedonic
		adaption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)
		to repeated drug-use (thus needing to "up the dose"
		to achieve a similar high in many drugs<!--TODO: find
		a cite?-->) that sporadic drug use is not completely
		offset by this. I think my life would be overall
		better if I took MDMA once a year (not more often
		because of the cardio- and neurotoxic effects<!--TODO:
		link-->); the comedown and subsequent hangover aren't
		bad enough to negate the positive qualia. Stimulants
		appear to speed up subjective time, which is another
		off-setting effect on their valence.
		*	I believe that specifically psychedelics have likely strongly
			increased the variance of qualia that
			are experienced by humans, and since most
			people speak positively of their trips, I'm
			inclined to believe that they are on average
			of positive valence. Psychedelic qualia are
			much "thicker", subjective time becomes much
			slower, the meaning of experiences increases
			(maybe by a [directed acyclic graph between
			experiences](https://qualiacomputing.com/2018/11/28/the-pseudo-time-arrow-explaining-phenomenal-time-with-implicit-causal-structures-in-networks-of-local-binding/)
			containing more edges?). I think most psychedelics
			consumption occurred since the second half of
			the 20th century, and given the intensity of
			psychedelic qualia they might be highly relevant
			in assessing whether progress in qualia has
			occurred.
	* __Spirituality__:
		* __Meditation__: Even though today probably more people than ever
		in history meditate<!--TODO: source?-->, I suspect that in terms
		of exotic and high-valenced meditation qualia, humanity might
		be regressing. Meditative qualia require a large investment of
		consecutive time, attention and mental energy, which I suspect
		fewer people are willing to invest. This might even be inversely
		linked to economic progress: faster growth rates lead to a larger
		amount of interest in novelty (counterforce: material abundance
		frees oneself to investigate avenues of self-actualization
		(or, in this case, self-deconstruction)). But the number of
		contemplative practitioners doesn't have to seem grown with the
		population, and it would be interesting to find numbers on the
		amount of monks in the world—and it seems worth noting that only
		~5% of Buddhist monks spend most of their time meditating<!--TODO:
		sources-->.
			* "As mentioned in chapter 7 on the fourth jhāna, at the
			time of the Buddha, after the monks and nuns finished
			their alms rounds, they would eat their midday meal,
			which would be at around ten or eleven o'clock in the
			morning. Then they would “go for the day's abiding”⁹
			and meditate until evening. Since they had not grown up
			with chairs, they had the capacity to sit cross-legged
			for an extended period of time. So if they were sitting
			for multiple hours at a time over a six- or seven-hour
			period, they were fare more likely to experience a very
			deep level of concentration. By the time they entered the
			fourth jhāna, their concentration was deep enough that
			the simile with its white cloth indeed captures the pure,
			bright mind they were experiencing." (Right Concentration
			(Leigh Brasington, 2015), p. 180)
		* __Religion__<!--TODO-->
	* __Art__: The variety of art available to each individual
	likely has increased, and I assume that people select art they
	enjoy, so I believe that there has been large progress in the
	positive qualia from art. This likely has especially happened
	since the advent of the internet (for most people after 2000):
	The creation and distribution speed of art has probably increased
	the availability to each human a thousandfold.
	* __Social Interaction__: People in western societies
	interact less socially than they did even 50 years
	ago<!--TODO: source-->, [universal culture is probably the
	cause](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/)
	and other nations will probably follow. People complain about
	this development, and many people enjoy social interaction much
	more than their revealed preferences show, this seems like a
	negative development. (Though one that should be salvageable!)
* __Animals__
	* __Factory farming__ is horrendous. I'm not sure whether
	it produces qualia that outweigh humanity's qualia
	(the answer to the question might come down to tricky
	debates about moral patienthood such as the sentience
	of invertebrates or how much chickens fear predators),
	but in raw numbers, "humans slaughter about [290 million

	to produce wool, milk, eggs, and honey. Counting
	somewhat conservatively, humans exploit at least 33
	orders of animals, across 13 classes and 6 phyla" ([Schukraft
	2020](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/XG86pCgqTweFsQyrd#The_Measurement_Problem)).
	It seems quite likely to me that the positive qualia produced by
	factory farming (in the form of gustatory pleasure for humans)
	do not outweigh the suffering of factory-farmed animals.
	* __[Wild
	animals](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/)__
	live in abject poverty, nearly always at the Malthusian
	limit. r-selected species have often hundreds or thousands
	of offspring, most of them die very young, most species
	with small animals are r-selected, most animals are small
	(If you want to imagine an average animal, don't imagine
	a panda—imagine a newborn bug. Maybe call him Sebastian
	before he gets eaten). It's [unclear whether bugs feel
	pain](https://reducing-suffering.org/do-bugs-feel-pain/),
	the estimate here is ~40% (I have not
	looked into newer estimates by e.g. Rethink
	Priorities). Since this means that ecosystems [probably have
	net-negative](./doc/bio/welfare/towards_welfare_biology_evolutionary_economics_of_animal_consciousness_and_suffering_ng_1995.pdf)
	qualia value, it appears more
	likely than not that [humanity growing has
	*reduced*](https://reducing-suffering.org/humanitys-net-impact-on-wild-animal-suffering/)
	the [wild animal
	suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org/hanpp-krausmann-et-al-2013/)
	in the world by destroying ecosystems, especially since the
	beginning of the industrial revolution. Further economic growth
	should continue this trend.
* __[Other Things](https://opentheory.net/2019/09/whats-out-there/)__
	* Since humanity has created technological artifacts that
	don't occur anywhere else in the universe, we could've
	created entirely new qualia varieties (e.g. humans have
	[created the cubic meter with the lowest temperature in the known
	universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/Absolute_zero#Very_low_temperatures),
	have achieved remarkable
	temperatures of [5.5·10¹² Kelvin in the
	LCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\(temperature\))
	and created objects of a [single element with very high
	purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_approaches_to_redefining_the_kilogram#Avogadro_project):
	I suspect that the highest-purity kilogram of copper in the
	reachable universe is probably found on earth, created by humans
	(I haven't checked whether this is true, though)). I don't know
	what the valence, energy parameter or entropy of human-created
	objects and systems might be.
	* If we have created novel qualia-varieties as a side-effect of
	technological progress, I strongly suspect this happened in the
	last 150 years—beforehand our basic material didn't deviate
	that far from naturally occurring objects.
