Two People on a Planet
======================

The Problem
-----------

Two people are placed on the opposite poles of a habitable, planet-sized
sphere with a clearly defined equator that is largely homogenous on its
surface (imagine a planet covered covered with sand or dust).

Each of the two has the following abilities:

* Knows where the equator/the poles lie, can distinguish them
* Walk at approximately the same speed
* Reason about the other person
* Is immortal
* Needs no sleep

Both lack all other abilities, including (but not limited to) creating
new technology, communicating when they are out of sight (no fireworks,
launching spaceships etc.).

Both people don't know each other, so they can't infer anything about each
others' behavior, they also didn't have the ability to communicate before.

There are two variations in this problem: In one, they can see each
others' footprints on the ground, in the other, this is not possible.

These two people want to find each other.

A Na√Øve Solution
----------------

If the two people are careless, they will just start walking with the
dim hope that they will eventually see each others' footprints on the
ground and the follow them.

And apparently, Munroe *did* write something about this! Find it, read
it, cite it.
