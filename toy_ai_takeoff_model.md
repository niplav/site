An Exploratory Toy AI Takeoff Model
===================================

> Warning: Beware things that are fun to argue.

*– [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky), [“Coherent Extrapolated Volition”](./doc/converging_preference_utilitarianism/coherent_extrapolated_volition_yudkowsky_2004.pdf "Coherent Extrapolated Volition"), 2004*

> Paraphrasing Roache (2008) the state of play is such that nobody
believes the result of a simulation, except the person who performed
the simulation, and everybody believes the result of an experiment,
except the person who ran the experiment.

*– Ryan G. McClarren, “Uncertainty Quantification and Predictive Computational Science“ p. 9, 2018*

(Although the quote apparently goes back to Einstein, see “The
advancement of science, and its burdens” p. 13, only there with "theory"
instead of "simulation").
