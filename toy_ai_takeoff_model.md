> __In [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem),
significant time has been spent on the question of
the intelligence of AI systems over time, especially during
[takeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Hard_vs._soft_takeoff).
An underappreciated argument in the debate has been the idea that the more
intelligent an AI system becomes, the better it can search the space of
possible optimization algorithms. This post proposes a computational model
of this process by creating an n-dimensional search space and then running
a very simple [hill-climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)
algorithm and brute-force search on that space. Possible further
improvements to the model are suggested, and implications are discussed.__

on in the AI safety community which I don’t understand why: it’s not
as if we haven’t got enough real work to do. So now we have meta-debates
about whether you should focus on short-term or long-term, or whether
we should try to reduce the conflict between the short-termers and the
long-termers and it’s like, there doesn’t need to be a conflict.

Introduction
------------

Many regard the trajectory of future AI development as
crucial<!--TODO: citation needed-->: when will AGI first be
developed? Will the development be slow, moderate, or fast (in
economic doublings, or in wallclock time)? Will one AGI system become a
[singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(global_governance)),
i.e come to dominate the whole world (individual vs. collective
takeoff)? Will AGIs FOOM<!--TODO: link-->, i.e growing unexpectedly
fast? And: will there be one or more discontinuity when AI systems
recursively self-improve? This text attempts to shine light on the last
question and highlight a (supposedly underappreciated) argument for one or
more discontinuities in AI takeoff based on a computational model of an AI
searching the space of possible optimization algorithms for stronger ones.

In the model, there are three possible ways of an AI improving its
intelligence:

* By working and investing a part of the money to buy more hardware (e.g. by a cloud provider). This should grow roughly exponentially, at a similar speed to the [Gross World Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product#Recent_growth) (although the model does not consider wall-clock time)
* By performing a very simple [hill-climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing) algorithm in the space of possible optimization algorithms, such as rewriting parts of its source code in [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) or making trivial small performance improvements
* By [brute-force searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) the space of possible optimization algorithms, possibly in the vincinity of the current algorithm

### Existing Approaches

The Argument
------------

The argument presented has the following premises:

* There exists a property of algorithms called “__optimization power__”
	* Optimization power describes (among other things) the ability of an algorithm to search a search space quickly and efficiently
* There is a space of algorithms, and each algorithm in that space can be given a number according to its optimization power
* The space of algorithms has certain properties
	* There are algorithms that have positive optimization power (>0)
	* There are algorithms that have vastly more optimization power than others

If these premises are accepted, it is possible for some search spaces to
construct an algorithm that attempts to find the best algorithm according
to its optimization power:

* Start with an algorithm with optimization power >0
* Let the algorithm search part of the search space for a better algorithm
	* If it finds one, it modifies itself to become that better algorithm
	* Else it does nothing
*	If it has searched the whole search space (or has proved that no
	better algorithm can exist), it stops the search
* The algorithm acquires some more resources such as computing power

This can be visualized quite nicely when one imagines the search space
to be one-dimensional with arbitrary values (or perhaps its [Gödel
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering)) on both axes
(which is of course not the case in reality):

![A jagged graph with a maximum in the middle, a vertical red line at the minimum at the left, and a small horizontal orange line on top of it, T-shaped](./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_2.png "A jagged graph with a maximum in the middle, a vertical red line at the minimum at the left, and a small horizontal orange line on top of it, T-shaped")

At the first step in the optimization process, the algorithm is very
weak and can only search a small portion of the space.

![The same graph with the two lines, and a lighter orange vertical line on top of the darker orange one. A wider horizontal yellow line on top of the light orange line](./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_4.png "The same graph with the two lines, and a lighter orange vertical line on top of the darker orange one. A wider horizontal yellow line on top of the light orange line")

At the second step in the optimization process, the algorithm is slightly
better than before and already defeating a local maximum.

![The same graph with the lines as before, but now an even higher light green vertical, wider dark green line on top, the whole constellation forming a “stair-like” pattern](./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_6.png "The same graph with the lines as before, but now an even higher light green vertical, wider dark green line on top, the whole constellation forming a “stair-like” pattern")

The algorithm is now much stronger, and exploring a sizeable fraction
of the search space.

![Same image as before, with a dark-green line on top of the highest horizontal one, now reaching the global maximum](./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_7.png "Same image as before, with a dark-green line on top of the highest horizontal one, now reaching the global maximum")

It has now practically found the global maximum.

The height of the vertical bar indicates the optimization power of
the current optimization process, while the width of the vertical bar
indicates the portion of the space searched by the current algorithm.
For simplicity, the current algorithm searches in its own vincinity,
which also might be a good heuristic (since similar algorithms might
have similar properties). The width of the horizontal bar increases as
the current optimization algorithm becomes stronger and stronger, which
leads to bigger subspaces being searched and in turn better algorithms
being found.

This argument might fail in many different ways, e.g. if
being more intelligent does not imply being more able to
search the space of optimization algorithms quickly (e.g. by
[compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression) and
searching the compressed data).

However, a conceptual argument is not sufficient here. It would be
advantageous to test whether a similarly explosive effect occurs in
higher-dimensional spaces with different characteristics.

The Model
---------

A computational model can shed some light on whether the argument above
would actually bring about discontinuities in the recursive development
of artificial intelligence, and can also provide a more concrete ground
for disagreement (for by creating an opportunity for people to modify
the code and show that different search spaces, search algorithms and
external factors generate different conclusions.

On a high level, in
[pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), the model executes
a code similar to this:

	space=gen_space()
	fill_space(space)

	pos=random_pos()

	factor=intelligence=1

	for i=0, rounds
		print(intelligence)
		factor*=1.001
		intelligence=max(1, space[pos])*factor
		pos=climb(space, pos)
		pos=search_subpart(space, pos, intelligence)

First, the space is generated and filled with values. Then, the AI
repeatedly grows a little bit, does some hill-climbing, and brute-force
searches the neighbouring space.

### Generating the Search Space

The search space the AI would be inquiring into here is the
[space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics))
of all possible algorithms. While I'm not very knowledgeable
about the structure of the space of algorithms, it seems
plausible to me that it would be isomorphic to the perfect [binary
tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) with infinite depth (for
any given [turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
with a binary tape).

<!--At the nth level, the parents describe the preceding bits, and the
node describes whether the nth bit is 0 or 1.-->

<!--Perhaps trinary tree? 0/1/$ for bits and ending-->

However, since I do not know algorithms that would assign
possible values to nodes in the tree, as well as fitting
search algorithms, I decided instead to use a [Euclidean
space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) to stand in for
the space of all algorithms. Specifically, the metric space was even
further simplified by an n-dimensional array with equal side-lengths:

	dim=5
	size=33
	space=np.zeros([size]*dim)

However, I might return to more accurate representations of the space
of possible algorithms.

<!--TODO: actually do that-->
