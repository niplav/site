> The fitness contribution of each of the `$\hat{n}$` heterozygous
loci to the parthenogenetic individual's overall fitness is
`$1+hs$`. If the overall fitness of an individual is the product
of the fitnesses of individual loci (multiplicative epistasis),
then the total fitness contribution of the `$\hat{n}$` heterozygous
loci is `$(1+hs)^{\hat{n}}$`. These same loci in the sexual species
will have sped to fixation, so their total fitness contribution is
`$(1+s)^{\hat{n}}$`. The relative advantage of the sexual species is
