Interventions to Slow Down Subjective Time
===========================================

[Existing](http://theoryengine.org/life/tips-for-a-longer-life/)
[investigations](https://www.wikihow.com/Slow-Down-Time) are not well
cited, don't consider trade-offs and costs or effect sizes, given that
subjective time is all one has, it'd be good to have a reliable guide
to lengthening it.
