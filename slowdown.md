[Existing](http://theoryengine.org/life/tips-for-a-longer-life/)
[investigations](https://www.wikihow.com/Slow-Down-Time) are not well
cited, don't consider trade-offs and costs or effect sizes, given that
subjective time is all one has, it'd be good to have a reliable guide
to lengthening it.

### Meditation

* [Kaul et al. 2010](./doc/meditation/science/meditation_acutely_improves_psychomotor_vigilance_and_may_decrease_sleep_need_kaul_et_al_2010.pdf) find that long-term meditators ~2.5h less at 2.3h meditation/day, which suggests that one can reap the benefits of meditation while also increasing the time spent lucid, if one values time in meditation half as much as other waking time, that still gives `$1.25h \cdot 365 \cdot 40 =18250h$` additional hours in a 40 year period.
