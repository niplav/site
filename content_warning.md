Content Warning
================

This website contains material that might be upsetting to many people,
including pick-up, race, gender, death, suffering, suicide, human
extinction and net-negative futures.

I write in a relatively clinical tone and avoid graphic descriptions,
but often can't (or don't want to) avoid mentioning or writing about
sensitive topics.

That said, most pages on this site are harmless for almost all people,
and the titles are usually a good indicator of whether you want to read
the text.

### Information Hazards

I am very careful about avoiding spreading information hazards<!--TODO:
read & link Bostrom paper--> and manipulative memes. If you believe
you have found such information on this website, please [contact
me](./about.html#Contact). For obvious reasons, I don't want to give
examples of such hazards, but abstractly, those would be information
that causes harm to a sufficient number (>10%) of people.

I reserve it to myself to judge some information an information hazard.
