> __Some people have been complaining about a [“website discoverability
crisis”](https://memex.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis.gmi).
While I haven't been affected by this particular problem (on the
contrary!), I want people to know some high-quality websites.__

put effort into their posts, are curious & coherent and who link to
other sites.
