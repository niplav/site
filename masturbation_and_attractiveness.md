Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach
===========================================================

Abstract
--------

Members of the nofap community frequently claim that male physical
attractiveness is causally influenced by the frequency and duration
since last occurence of masturbation.

I present a method to test this claim (albeit imperfectly) by approaching
200 people in the street after 90 days of abstinence from masturbation and
asking them for a date, and again after a week of daily masturbation. The
results are discussed and find that \_.

Examples for the Claim
-----------------------

To prevent the accusation of straw-manning the views of the nofap
community, I hereby present sentiments that broadly go in the direction
of the idea that "male abstinence from masturbation results in higher
attractiveness, even with fixed behavior."

To show that this is at least moderately the case, I searched the
[/r/nofap](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) subreddit for "attractiveness"
and "attractive", and collected comments and posts claiming that nofap
made them more attractive.

> Yesterday i was at a party and im currently on 12 days nofap. Normally
this really never happens but a girl wanted to Kiss me. I think it was
because of nofap.

Another user recounts a similar story:

> I’m minding my own business in the laundromat, keeping to myself, this
girl walks up to me and asks me if I can drop her off to her house, that
she lives 2 minutes away. I look at her and ask her what made her come up
to a complete stranger and ask such a thing, she says she doesn’t know,
we have a little laugh. I drop her off, help her unload her laundry,
and as I’m almost driving off she asks me if I need to head back,
which I did, my laundry had 10 minutes left in the wash. I realized as I
driving away that this stranger was literally inviting me in her house to
get smashed, but I was genuinely trying to her [sic], I had no ulterior
motives, and I wasn’t even that attracted to her. They literally smell
it on you. I’m also 119 days hard mode. This shit is crazy.

Note that the poster does not mention any specific action on his side.

A [commenter](https://old.reddit.com/user/AustinReckless)
[suspects](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bzj8ra/they_smell_it_on_you/eqt5bsv/):
"Must be able to smell the pheromones." (23
upvotes). Another user [makes a similar
claim](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bzj8ra/they_smell_it_on_you/eqti6xg/).

There are also strong claims on a direct relation between masturbation and attractiveness:

> I was on a 10 day streak before I took a week off from work. When
returning people were saying "I look tired" (I Fapped 5 times in the 2
days before returning to work). And the chick that I work with that is
normally all walkative and flirty with me was not so much and seemed to
act like I wasn't even there LOL. […] On a 20 day streak one time I had
one after another woman looking at me. I recall one was a receptionist at
an office building and when I went in and walked up to her coworker she
was just gazing at me almost that bite your lip look, and honestly looked
like she was getting wet. […] It's almost comical how woman treat me
when on a streak, and when off one. It's night and day different. […]
off a streak or over ejaculation several times in a day, it seems woman
look past me and don't ever look at me. I know it has something to do
with the pheromones you emit when not spilling your seed needlessly all
the time […].

Note that all typos and grammatical mistakes could be affixed with "[sic]"
(the comment was copy-pasted).

This user claims there is a noticeable difference between the behavior
of women in regard to abstinence from masturbation, and attributes this
difference to "pheromones".

Another user claims this ["difference in how people (both men and women)
respond"](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3mt0nu/fapping_ruins_your_attractiveness/cvhvbdc/)
is visible in both genders.

Another commenter
[agrees](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3mt0nu/fapping_ruins_your_attractiveness/cvhyqwb/),
but a response is critical:

> I lost my nearly 28 day streak last night. Didn't notice a difference
apart from thinking more aggressive at times and thinking average women
were hot\wanting to bang them.  
>Nobody ever approached me or started convos.  
>Will try longer this time.

Other users try to condone him.

Since the claims are quite repetitve, I will now just list them and write
down important key words from the claim (especially the time it takes for
the effect to take place, the effect itself and the given explanation).

> Sorry to all the doubters or people that it hasn't worked for. But
this is my fourth time getting to 40+ days. And EVERY DAMN TIME I get
to this point girls start hitting on me.
> Some people say it's placebo. But to that I say (even if that is the
case) well then it still works.
> Whether it's psychological or physiological is irrelevant.

*– [topdizzel](https://old.reddit.com/user/topdizzel), [“I'm sorry, but no fap just fucking works”](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9treo6/im_sorry_but_no_fap_just_fucking_works/) on [/r/NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap) (606 upvotes), 2018*

Effect takes place after 40 days, women started hitting on him, reason:
possibly placebo.

A commenter agrees:

> I will vouch for this. I'm on 84 days (nearly 90!) And I keep getting
hit on.

Effect takes place after at least 84 days, women start hitting on him.

A broad picture emerges: Long-term abstinence from masturbation has
noticeable effects on male attractiveness for women, this effect emerges
at around 40 days or more (and doesn't diminish with the time since
the last masturbation increasing), it also has an effect on other men,
though this is not really elaborated further. The effects are noticeable.

Given these claims, it should be possible to broadly test the claims
made by members of the NoFap community.

Preregistration
---------------

To avoid p-hacking and other practices, the bulk of the text was written
before the actual experiment and data analysis was conducted, and posted
on the [nofap subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) as well as
to the subreddit [/r/niplav](https://old.reddit.com/r/niplav), with the
SHA256 hashsum of the text as the title. The SHA256 sum of the content was
put into the title to prevent tampering with the content of the article,
because reddit titles can't be changed by users of reddit. <!--TODO:
source for that claim-->

The pre-registered hypothesis thus shall be H₀:

	There is no statistically significant difference in success
	from cold approach before and and long term abstinence from
	masturbation. (p<0.05)

Existing Literature
-------------------

Method
------

Data was collected as follows:

I abstined <!--TODO: What is the correct verb for abstinence?--> from
masturbating from \_ to \_. From \_ to \_, I went on the streets of a
major german city and approached 100 men and women alternatingly with
the words:

No approaches for 1 week before dataset.

Streets in center of a major german city.  
≥90 days of masturbation abstinence,  
Approach 100 women & 100 men (alternating) with  
"Hey, I know this is really spontaneous, but I just saw you and thought  
you were really attractive. Would you like to go on a date with me?"  
7 days daily masturbation  
Repeat  

Results Analysis
-----------------

Does the hypothesis hold up?

Make nice bargraphs & so on

Problems
--------

* Approaching of men/women I find attractive, not objective measure
* Different perception of attractiveness before&after masturbation
* Different settings/clothing/weather
* Only N=1 on the asker's side.

Conclusion
