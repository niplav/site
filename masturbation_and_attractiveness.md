Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach
===========================================================

Abstract
--------

Members of the nofap community frequently claim that male physical
attractiveness is causally influenced by the frequency and duration
since last occurence of masturbation.

I present a method to test this claim (albeit imperfectly) by approaching
200 people in the street after 90 days of abstinence from masturbation and
asking them for a date, and again after a week of daily masturbation. The
results are discussed and find that \_.

Examples for the Claim
-----------------------

To prevent the accusation of straw-manning the views of the nofap
community, I hereby present sentiments that broadly go in the direction
of the idea that "male abstinence from masturbation results in higher
attractiveness, even with fixed behavior."

To show that this is at least moderately the case, I searched the
[/r/nofap](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) subreddit for "attractiveness"
and "attractive", and collected comments and posts claiming that nofap
made them more attractive.

> Yesterday i was at a party and im currently on 12 days nofap. Normally
this really never happens but a girl wanted to Kiss me. I think it was
because of nofap.

Another user recounts a similar story:

> I’m minding my own business in the laundromat, keeping to myself, this
girl walks up to me and asks me if I can drop her off to her house, that
she lives 2 minutes away. I look at her and ask her what made her come up
to a complete stranger and ask such a thing, she says she doesn’t know,
we have a little laugh. I drop her off, help her unload her laundry,
and as I’m almost driving off she asks me if I need to head back,
which I did, my laundry had 10 minutes left in the wash. I realized as I
driving away that this stranger was literally inviting me in her house to
get smashed, but I was genuinely trying to her [sic], I had no ulterior
motives, and I wasn’t even that attracted to her. They literally smell
it on you. I’m also 119 days hard mode. This shit is crazy.

Preregistration
---------------

To avoid p-hacking and other practices, the bulk of the text was written
before the actual experiment and data analysis was conducted, and posted
on the [nofap subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) as well as to
the subreddit [/r/niplav](https://old.reddit.com/r/niplav), with the
`sha256sum` of the text as the title. The hash sum was put into the
title to prevent tampering with the content of the article to prevent

H₀:
"There is no statistically significant difference in success from cold approach before and and long term abstinence from masturbation."

Existing Literature
-------------------

Method
------

Data was collected as follows:

I abstined <!--TODO: What is the correct verb for abstinence?--> from
masturbating from 2019-08-17 to 2019-12-01. From 2019-11-30 to 2019-12-01,
I went on the streets of a major german city and approached 100 men and women
alternatingly with the words:

No approaches for 1 week before dataset.

Streets in center of a major german city.  
≥90 days of masturbation abstinence,  
Approach 100 women & 100 men (alternating) with  
"Hey, I know this is really spontaneous, but I just saw you and thought  
you were really attractive. Would you like to go on a date with me?"  
7 days daily masturbation  
Repeat  

Results Analysis
-----------------

Does the hypothesis hold up?

Make nice bargraphs & so on

Problems
--------

* Approaching of men/women I find attractive, not objective measure
* Different perception of attractiveness before&after masturbation
* Different settings/clothing/weather
* Only N=1 on the asker's side.

Conclusion
