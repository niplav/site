Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach

Abstract
--------

Members of the NoFap community frequently claim that male physical
attractiveness is causally influenced by the frequency and duration
since last occurence of masturbation.

I present a method to test this claim (albeit imperfectly) by approaching
200 people in the street after 90 days of abstinence from masturbation and
asking them for a date, and again after a week of daily masturbation. The
results are discussed and find that \_.

Preregistration
---------------

To avoid p-hacking and other practices, the bulk of this text
was written before the actual experiment and data analysis was
conducted, and posted<!--TODO: when posted, put link here--> on
the [NoFap subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) as well as
to the subreddit [/r/niplav](https://old.reddit.com/r/niplav),
with the SHA256 hashsum of the text as the title. The
SHA256 sum of the content was put into the title to prevent
tampering with the content of the article, because reddit titles [can't be
changed](https://old.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_i_made_a_mistake_in_my_submission_title.2C_how_can_i_edit_it.3F)
by users of reddit.

The pre-registered hypothesis thus shall be H₀:

	There is no statistically significant difference in success
	from cold approach before and and long term abstinence from
	masturbation. (p<0.05)

### Reasoning

If it were true that abstinence from masturbation increased
attractiveness to the opposite sex, evolutionary pressure would
have selected men who abstain from masturbating, since they generate
a higher number of offspring. This would be true regardless of the
specific way in which abstinence from masturbation increases fitness,
be it pheromones, microexpressions or any other reason. Indeed,
one could suppose that masturbation is reproductively beneficial,
since it has apparently been selected for by natural and/or sexual
selection. <!--TODO: search for examples of animal species masturbating,
as well as the reasoning about the evolutionary reasons for masturbation:

Existing Literature

<!--TODO: Search google scholar for "abstinence masturbation
attractiveness", "abstinence masturbation pheromones" and "abstinence
masturbation microexpressions". The last time I checked, there was
nothing there, but it might have changed.-->

Examples for the Claim
-----------------------

To prevent the accusation of straw-manning the views of the NoFap
community, I hereby present sentiments that broadly go in the direction
of the idea that "male abstinence from masturbation results in higher
attractiveness, even with fixed behavior."

To show that this is at least moderately the case, I searched the
[/r/NoFap](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) subreddit for "attractiveness"
and "attractive", and collected comments and posts claiming that NoFap
made them more attractive.

> Yesterday i was at a party and im currently on 12 days nofap. Normally
this really never happens but a girl wanted to Kiss me. I think it was
because of nofap.

Another user recounts a similar story:

> I’m minding my own business in the laundromat, keeping to myself, this
girl walks up to me and asks me if I can drop her off to her house, that
she lives 2 minutes away. I look at her and ask her what made her come up
to a complete stranger and ask such a thing, she says she doesn’t know,
we have a little laugh. I drop her off, help her unload her laundry,
and as I’m almost driving off she asks me if I need to head back,
which I did, my laundry had 10 minutes left in the wash. I realized as I
driving away that this stranger was literally inviting me in her house to
get smashed, but I was genuinely trying to her [sic], I had no ulterior
motives, and I wasn’t even that attracted to her. They literally smell
it on you. I’m also 119 days hard mode. This shit is crazy.

Note that the poster does not mention any specific action on his side.

A [commenter](https://old.reddit.com/user/AustinReckless)
[suspects](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bzj8ra/they_smell_it_on_you/eqt5bsv/):
"Must be able to smell the pheromones." (23
upvotes). Another user [makes a similar
claim](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bzj8ra/they_smell_it_on_you/eqti6xg/).

There are also strong claims on a direct relation between masturbation and attractiveness:

> I was on a 10 day streak before I took a week off from work. When
returning people were saying "I look tired" (I Fapped 5 times in the 2
days before returning to work). And the chick that I work with that is
normally all walkative and flirty with me was not so much and seemed to
act like I wasn't even there LOL. […] On a 20 day streak one time I had
one after another woman looking at me. I recall one was a receptionist at
an office building and when I went in and walked up to her coworker she
was just gazing at me almost that bite your lip look, and honestly looked
like she was getting wet. […] It's almost comical how woman treat me
when on a streak, and when off one. It's night and day different. […]
off a streak or over ejaculation several times in a day, it seems woman
look past me and don't ever look at me. I know it has something to do
with the pheromones you emit when not spilling your seed needlessly all
the time […].

Note that all typos and grammatical mistakes could be affixed with "[sic]"
(the comment was copy-pasted).

This user claims there is a noticeable difference between the behavior
of women in regard to abstinence from masturbation, and attributes this
difference to "pheromones".

Another user claims this ["difference in how people (both men and women)
respond"](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3mt0nu/fapping_ruins_your_attractiveness/cvhvbdc/)
is visible in both genders.

Another commenter
[agrees](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3mt0nu/fapping_ruins_your_attractiveness/cvhyqwb/),
but a response is critical:

> I lost my nearly 28 day streak last night. Didn't notice a difference
apart from thinking more aggressive at times and thinking average women
were hot\wanting to bang them.  
>Nobody ever approached me or started convos.  
>Will try longer this time.

Other users try to condone him.

Since the claims are quite repetitve, I will now just list them and write
down important key words from the claim (especially the time it takes for
the effect to take place, the effect itself and the given explanation).

> Sorry to all the doubters or people that it hasn't worked for. But
this is my fourth time getting to 40+ days. And EVERY DAMN TIME I get
to this point girls start hitting on me.

Effect takes place after 40 days, women started hitting on him, reason:
possibly placebo.

A commenter agrees:

This commenter attributes the higher attractiveness to higher
self-confidence.

> All men are trying to find ways to make themselves more attractive
to the females around them. It’s a constant battle to outmaneuver the
other guys around you.  
Luckily, most guys don’t know how NoFap can cause extreme levels
of attraction.  
Here’s how this works; while you were doing PMO, you were masking
your inner beauty. You were hiding your personality from all the girls
around you. Once you stop doing PMO, talking and bonding with other
people becomes much easier. Your outer look is only a reflection of your
inner thoughts.  
Girls have a sixth-sense about knowing how powerful a guy is. Power is
the thing that attracts girls the most. The more in control you are,
the more girls are going to be able to sense this. […]  
To sum up – NoFap is going to make you more attractive to the opposite
sex […]

It seems like this redditor claims that micro-expressions are the cause
of higher attractiveness, though the "sixth sense" could refer to more
"spiritual" way of transmitting information.

A commenter specifically refers to micro-expressions:

> It doesn't make you "more attractive" in the physical sense, although it
might support that as a side effect but not directly.[…]  
> Here's the rundown on how it "makes men more attractive"; You constantly
transmit micro expressions. You are a walking transmitter whether you like
it or not. Women, they have a sharper decoder that men have, and they are
much better, subconsciously, decoding the codes you transmit.[…]  
> Fapping, essentially, other than a huge surge of dopamine that makes
you lazy and self destructive, is also a simulator for the mind that
you are getting laid. […] As long as you see naked women, hear
them do the thing, and have your peepee touched, your mind perceives it as
sex. […] So, when your mind is extremely satisfied (sex every day would be a fucking
luxury for a caveman), your mind stops "supporting" your sexuality and
the need to attract females. Your thoughts and desires become mundane,
you stop focusing on yourself, you care less about your physique and
looks, and you tend to communicate with females with a much softer
sexual aggression […]. […] when you are in a long Nofap period, your mind is being
rewired to suddenly care about your reproduction and gene survival, so
your communication becomes more aggressive, therefore attractive.
[…] your body language improves.[…]
> This works with nofap too. When you're deprived of sex, your mind will
help you make yourself attractive and will push you to desire sex.

They also talk about increased amounts of flirting in conversations,
higher sexual aggressiveness and higher motivation to find a partner,
which should at least partially be testable during cold approach.

They don't seem to think about the fact that masturbation is
not a feature of modern civilisation, but rather a biological
instinct. Widespread pornography, on the other hand, is a feature of
modern civilisation.<!--TODO: sources for these claims-->

Another commenter refers to this baseless speculation as "science":

> A healthy dose of actual science on here. This post should be stickied
IMO. Everyone on here would benefit so much if they understood the
underlying mechanics of our natural biology and neuro chemistry. The
NoFap movement would never have kicked off like it did if there wasn't
actual science to back it up.

A commenter claiming to be a scientist says:

> Well essentially due to the addiction. It causes lowered sensitivity
to neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin this causes lowered
motivation, dry skin, depression and anxiety. As a result of quitting
porn ones sensitivity to neurotransmitters return and their neuropathways
start functioning correctly (hence no brain fog)

If this is true, then abstinence from masturbation should lead to increased
mental health, but except "clearer skin" there is no obvious way in
which this would increase attractiveness.

Another commenter
[claims](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/bl2ioe/can_nofap_really_make_you_more_attractive/emli3ml/)
that his "face has this droopy tired look" during periods of masturbation.

> Increased sexual interest from others. Many rebooters claim they
notice more signals of sexual attraction directed at them: more looks,
more smiles, more flirting. Many believe this to be a side-effect of
feeling more confident, while others theorize that rebooters simply
notice more signals than they did when they were obsessed with porn.

*– [NoFap.com](https://nofap.com/), [“Rebooting from Porn Addiction”](https://nofap.com/rebooting/), 2017*

A broad picture emerges: Long-term abstinence from masturbation has
noticeable effects on male attractiveness for women, this effect emerges
at around 40 days or more (and doesn't diminish with the time since
the last masturbation increasing), it also has an effect on other men,
though this is not really elaborated further. The effects are noticeable.

The reasons given for this increase in attractiveness are as follows:

* Microexpressions
* Pheromones
* Placebo effect
* Higher effort in searching partners

Two of these reasons are independent from the attitude of a person
towards NoFap (pheromones and microexpressions), while the others are
dependent on being a NoFap enthusiast.

Given these claims, it should be possible to broadly test the claims
made by members of the NoFap community.

Method
------

To test the claims by the NoFap community, I performed a small
self-experiment.

Important information about me: I am a male living in a european country,
my age being in the early twenties. I seem to fall into the same category
of people as most of the NoFap community.

Data was collected as follows:

I abstained from masturbating from 2019-10-16T02:15 to \_, resulting
in >90 days of abstinence from masturbation (which is also the period
[recommended by the NoFap community](https://nofap.com/rebooting/)):
"NoFap’s gold standard of success is our 90-day reboot."). From \_
to \_, I went on the streets of a major european city and approached
100 men and 100 women (perceived gender) alternatingly with the words

> Hi, I know this is really spontaneous, but I just saw you and thought
you looked really nice. What is your name?

The other person answered with their name, and I replied with

> Nice to meet you, <name\>. To make a long story short, I'd like to
take you out on a date sometime. When are you free?

In the week following the last approach, I masturbated once every day.
Afterwards, I repeated the procedure of approaching 100 men and 100 women
with the same words.

Data that was logged included date and time of day (in ISO-8601),
whether the approach was after abstinence from masturbation or after
the one-week period of masturbation (1 for the part after abstinence,
and 0 for the part after masturbation), perceived gender of the person
approached ("m", "f" or "o"), and how far the interaction went:

* 1 (ignored): the person walked past and did not react
* 2 (stopped): the person stopped, but didn't answer any question (started laughing or walking away)
* 3 (name): person gave name, but then started walking away
* 4 (rejection): person answered that they were in a relationship/had no interest
* 5 (flake): person gave contact information, but did not reply
* 6 (date): person showed up to the date

Results were logged in a CSV file.

Results Analysis
-----------------

### Visualizing the Results

Cold approach is a conversion funnel: there are a number of different
stages an approachee goes through, and each one can fail. This way, one
can visualize how far the interaction went by making a bar graph of the
people dropping out at a certain stage (ignoring the approach, stopping
but not giving a name, giving a nam but not agreeing to come on a date,
agreeing to come on a date but flaking, and showing up to a date).
Showing up to the date was considered a condition of success, but one
could imagine further steps like having sex, getting into a relationship
with the person, getting married with the person and having children with
the person, though these were deemed excessive and out of the scope of
a simple self-experiment.

The bargraph below shows how many people were lost at which stage
of the funnel, ignoring gender. The white bars show the numbers
during a period of abstinence from masturbation, after 90 days
of abstinence, the black bars show the numbers after a period of
weekly masturbation.

Code:

	.l("nplot")
	.l("./load.kg")

	cgrid(["ignored" "stopped" "name" "rejection" "flake" "date"];[0 100 10])

	text(20;400;"white: during abstinence, before masturbation, black: after masturbation")

	fillrgb(0;0;0)
	{bar(2*x;(#'=during@<during)@x;12)}'!6
	fillrgb(1;1;1)
	{bar(1+2*x;(#'=after@<after)@x;12)}'!6

	draw()

![Gender non-specific loss in different stages of the funnel](./img/masturbation_and_attractiveness/dur_after_bar.png "Gender non-specific loss in different stages of the funnel.")

### Testing the Hypothesis

Problems
--------

* Approaching of men/women I find attractive, not objective measure
* Different perception of attractiveness before&after masturbation
* Different settings/clothing/weather
* Only N=1 on the asker's side.
