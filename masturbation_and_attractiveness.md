Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach
===========================================================

Abstract
--------

Motivation, Examples for claim

TODO: Find threads on /r/nofap claiming this

Preregistration (H₀):
"There is no statistically significant difference in success from cold approach before and and long term abstinence from masturbation."

Method
------

≥90 days of masturbation abstinence,
Approach 100 women & 100 men (alternating) with
"Hey, I know this is really spontaneous, but I just saw you and thought
you were really attractive. Would you like to go on a date with me?"
7 days daily masturbation
Repeat

Results Analysis
-----------------

Does the hypothesis hold up?

Make nice bargraphs & so on

Problems
--------

* Approaching of men/women I find attractive, not objective measure
* Different perception of attractiveness before&after masturbation
* Different settings/clothing/weather
* Only N=1 on the asker's side.

Conclusion
----------
