Websites
---------

> A proposal, dear reader: Create a list of bookmarks linking
to websites you find interesting, and publish it for the world
to see. You decide what constitutes "interesting". The model
is as recursive as it is simple. There is nothing preventing a
list of bookmarks from linking to another list of bookmarks.

### Sites

My favorite form of online expression is the [long
site](https://www.gwern.net/About), best exemplified by
[Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/), [Essays on Reducing
Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org), [Gavin
Leech](https://www.gleech.org), [210ethan](https://210ethan.github.io),
and [Yujiri's homepage](https://yujiri.xyz) (a [very
Russian](https://yujiri.xyz/misc/structure.gmi.html) website: "This site's
organization is different from most other sites that serve a similar
purpose. It's not chronological like a blog, because it was never meant
to be a personal voice for me, at least not primarily. It's meant to be
an up-to-date, organized database of philosophical truth.").

### Blogs

My favorite general knowledge blogs are [Nintil](https://nintil.com/)
and [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/); my favorite blogs
about rationality are [Less Wrong](https://lesswrong.com/),
[Everything Studies](https://everythingstudies.com/),
[Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/), [Slate Star
Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/), and [☆✦ The Scintillating But
Ultimately Untrue Thought ✦☆](https://unremediatedgender.space)
(which is highly focused on a rather irrelevant topic,
but the lessons are generalizable); my favorite programming
blogs are [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/),
[Drew DeVault's Blog](https://drewdevault.com/),
[Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
and [Null Program](http://nullprogram.com/); my favorite
mathematics blogs are [Bit-Player](http://bit-player.org/),
[Math ∩ Programming](https://jeremykun.com/),
[Shtetl-Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog) and [An
Algorithmic Lucidity](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/); my favorite
philosophy blogs are [Entirely Useless](https://entirelyuseless.com/) and
[Metamoderna](http://metamoderna.org/?lang=en).

I don't read many blogs about politics per se,
but I like the (in different ways) spicy [The Real
Movement](https://therealmovement.wordpress.com/) and [Unqualified
Reservations](https://unqualified-reservations.org/); good insight porn is
hard to come by these days, but I have made good catch by trawling through
the archives of [Hotel Concierge](https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/),
[The Last Psychiatrist](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/),
[sam[]zdat](https://samzdat.com/), [An Algorithmic
Lucidity](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/) and [Traditions of
Conflict](https://traditionsofconflict.com).

Meditation is better done than read about, but if you have to,
[Meditation Stuff](https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com) and [Neurotic
Gradient Descent](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com)
are great places to; similar with pickup and [The Red
Quest](https://theredquest.wordpress.com)/[Days of
Game](https://daysofgame.com).

My favorite blogs about Effective Altruism are [Reflective
Disequilibrium](https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com)
and [Rational Altruist](https://rationalaltruist.com)
(both unfortunately inactive), the [Effective Altruism
Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/allposts) is of
course widely known & loved, and I like the [Qualia Research
Institute](https://qualiaresearchinstitute.org/research-publications)
and [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research)
(if just because I actually read the stuff they put out).

As for fiction, [Zero HP
Lovecraft](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/) and [Things of
Interest](https://qntm.org) present two very different (but both
delightful) options. The [SCP Wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) is also
one of a kind, a true product of the internet age.

My favorite wikis are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/),
[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/), the
[Xenharmonic Wiki](https://en.xen.wiki/) and the [Arbital AI Alignment
Domain](https://arbital.org/explore/ai_alignment) (sadly defunct); my
favorite social media site was [schelling.pt](https://schelling.pt) (now
sadly defunct<!--TODO: link-->); and my favorite forecasting/news sites
are still the good ol' reliable [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com)
and [PredictionBook](https://www.predictionbook.com).

Mathematics
------------

My favorite mathematical structure is
[∅](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set),
my favorite theorem is the [Bulow-Klemperer
theorem](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1440/lectures/2022/bulow_klemperer.pdf),
and my favorite proof is the [Classification of finite simple
groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups)
(not that I understand it).

My *least* favorite mathematical mathematical technique is [spectral
clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering),
and I am incredibly suspicious of [spectral graph
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory) in
particular.

My favorite algorithms are the [IC\*
algorithm](https://rpatrik96.github.io/posts/2021/11/2021-11-22-poc8-ic-ic-ic),
[Kadane's
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem#Kadane's_algorithm),
the [Bron-Kerbosch
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm),
and

other people, hm…).
