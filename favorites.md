Websites
---------

### Sites

My favorite form of online expression is the [long
site](https://www.gwern.net/About), best exemplified by
[Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/), [Essays on Reducing
Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org), [Gavin
Leech](https://www.gleech.org), [210ethan](https://210ethan.github.io),
and [Yujiri's homepage](https://yujiri.xyz) (a [very
Russian](https://yujiri.xyz/misc/structure.gmi.html) website: "This site's
organization is different from most other sites that serve a similar
purpose. It's not chronological like a blog, because it was never meant
to be a personal voice for me, at least not primarily. It's meant to be
an up-to-date, organized database of philosophical truth.").

### Blogs

My favorite general knowledge blogs are [Nintil](https://nintil.com/)
and [Dynomight](https://dynomight.net/); my favorite blogs
about rationality are [Less Wrong](https://lesswrong.com/),
[Everything Studies](https://everythingstudies.com/),
[Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/), [Slate Star
Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/), and [☆✦ The Scintillating But
Ultimately Untrue Thought ✦☆](https://unremediatedgender.space)
(which is highly focused on a rather irrelevant topic,
but the lessons are generalizable); my favorite programming
blogs are [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/),
[Drew DeVault's Blog](https://drewdevault.com/),
[Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
and [Null Program](http://nullprogram.com/); my favorite
mathematics blogs are [Bit-Player](http://bit-player.org/),
[Math ∩ Programming](https://jeremykun.com/),
[Shtetl-Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog) and [An
Algorithmic Lucidity](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/); my favorite
philosophy blogs are [Entirely Useless](https://entirelyuseless.com/) and
[Metamoderna](http://metamoderna.org/?lang=en).

I don't read many blogs about politics per se,
but I like the (in different ways) spicy [The Real
Movement](https://therealmovement.wordpress.com/) and [Unqualified
Reservations](https://unqualified-reservations.org/); good insight porn is
hard to come by these days, but I have made good catch by trawling through
the archives of [Hotel Concierge](https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/),
[The Last Psychiatrist](https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/),
[sam[]zdat](https://samzdat.com/), [An Algorithmic
Lucidity](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/) and [Traditions of
Conflict](https://traditionsofconflict.com).

Meditation is better done than read about, but if you have to,
[Meditation Stuff](https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com) and [Neurotic
Gradient Descent](https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com)
are great places to; similar with pickup and [The Red
Quest](https://theredquest.wordpress.com)/[Days of
Game](https://daysofgame.com).

My favorite blogs about Effective Altruism are [Reflective
Disequilibrium](https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com)
and [Rational Altruist](https://rationalaltruist.com)
(both unfortunately inactive), the [Effective Altruism
Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/allposts) is of
course widely known & loved, and I like the [Qualia Research
Institute](https://qualiaresearchinstitute.org/research-publications)
and [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research)
(if just because I actually read the stuff they put out).

As for fiction, [Zero HP
Lovecraft](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/) and [Things of
Interest](https://qntm.org) present two very different (but both
delightful) options. The [SCP Wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) is also
one of a kind, a true product of the internet age.

My favorite wikis are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/) and the [Arbital
AI Alignment Domain](https://arbital.org/explore/ai_alignment)
(sadly defunct); my favorite social media site
is [schelling.pt](https://schelling.pt); and my
favorite forecasting/news sites are still the good ol'
reliable [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com) and
[PredictionBook](https://www.predictionbook.com).

groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups)
(not that I understand it).

algorithm](https://rpatrik96.github.io/posts/2021/11/2021-11-22-poc8-ic-ic-ic),
