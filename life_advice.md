Life Advice
=============

Disclaimer: I only follow parts of the advice given in here, though my
idealized version follows it nearly completely. I also believe that
following this advice completely is probably too hard, but following
it has monotonically increasing gains.

However, as always, the [law of equal and opposite
advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/)
applies, [people are
different](https://everythingstudies.com/2017/04/24/people-are-different/).

And, as always, remember that I'm just a person on the internet.

<!--Separate into value-laden and value-agnostic advice-->

<!--Preparing for civilizational collapse? Which?-->

1. Do the obvious things
	* Exercise any amount
		*	Even walking around outside for 10 minutes a
			day is better than nothing
		*	By my best guess, the 30th minute of exercise
			a day probably has zero net marginal life
			expectancy (taking a baseline of jogging,
			high-intensity interval training probably needs
			less). If you are at hat point, you're probably
			in the 90th percentile of people doing exercise
			anyway. More probably isn't really needed,
			even for becoming better looking.
	* Eat vegetables and fruit
		* Dates are very tasty
		* Raw salad can be snacked like chips while watching a movie
	* Drink mostly water
	* Get enough sleep to not be tired during the day
	* Eliminate debt, invest money you have lying around
	* Spend less time sitting
		* The alternatives are standing (e.g. at a standing desk) and walking
	* Try to spend less time in front of screens
	* Try to be better looking
		* General hygiene
		* Dressing better
		* Mannerisms, Voice, Posture, Smell
		*	Some people seem to make not caring about how they
			look like as part of their identity
			*	I think this is a big mistake, being better
				looking is net positive in nearly all situations,
				including both finding partners and job interviews
	* Floss <!--TODO: find out whether the research supports this-->
	* Follow the advice in [Muehlhauser 2011](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oi873FWi6pHWxswSa/p/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9 "How to Be Happy")
	<!--Link Interventions for longevity from LW-->
2. There is value-laden and value-agnostic advice. Most advice is value-laden. Before you carry out some advice, check whether it actually corresponds to your values.
	* This also applies to all advice in this post (yes, even self-referentially)
3. Make things you endorse part of your identity (but not too much)
	*	Example: On the subreddit
		[/r/hydrohomies](https://old.reddit.com/r/hydrohomies),
		people build a strong identity around drinking water. This
		is probably good.
4. If you are like me, you probably underestimate the value of good gear
	*	Example: I spent around 200 hours meditating on
		a folded sheet. Then I got a zafu, which was so much more
		comfortable. Major improvement in my practice.
5. Choose your hobbies so that they solve big problems in your life
	* Example for myself: I didn't get laid, so I made daygame one of my hobbies
6. Try to identify addictive loops early and destroy them as early as possible
	* The longer you wait, the harder they become to root out
	* This will probably become a bigger problem in the future
7. Sign up for [cryonics](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html) (if you can afford it).
	* It's [likely worth it](./considerations_on_cryonics.html)
8.	People have a strong sense that once they come into remote contact
	with something bad, it makes them a bad person, no matter
	how small the badness or how remote the contact. You probably
	do this as well. This is both psychologically unhealthy and
	makes no sense, since it usually doesn't take into account
	the quantity of badness ("all bad things are equally bad")
	and doesn't weigh it against the quantity of goodness produced
	(disallowing offsetting). Try to recognize when you do this, and
	if other people do this to you, and ignore it.
	*	Example: If you start investing money,
		some people will probably tell you that you might be
		giving money to unethical companies. While this might
		be true, due to market efficiency arguments (especially about
		[replaceability](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5ykoKBcHBz6pXHLHu/replaceability))
		and the small number of unethical companies, this is probably
		negligible, and it neglects the massive positive effects of economic growth [Halstead & Hillebrandt, 2020](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-rand "Growth and the case against randomista development")
	* Instead, try to focus on the higher-order bits, e.g. [Effective
		Altruism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/)
		or [peak
		experiences](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gtGe8WkeFvqucYLAF/logarithmic-scales-of-pleasure-and-pain-rating-ranking-and), of course while still maximizing expected value
	* Related: [The Copenhagen Interpretation of
		Ethics](https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/),
		[Umeshisms](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=40),
		[Asymmetric Justice](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YRgMCXMbkKBZgMz4M)
9. Have a long-term plan to completely or nearly completely phase the internet out of your life
	*	The internet will probably become more addictive over time,
		and the increase in addictiveness will probably accelerate
	* Technology is becoming more powerful, while the power of the human brain stays pretty much constant (maybe cultural evolution linearly develops better defenses)
	* If this process crosses a certain
		threshold, humanity is [probably
		doomed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like)
		* But you can still spend the remaining time well!
		* Or even try to prevent it <!--TODO: link No time like present for AI safety research-->
	* Post on this [forthcoming some time](./leave_the_internet.html)
10. If you are looking for solutions to problems, look for zero-willpower/zero-inspiration solutions first
	* The best example for this is buying a product that solves your problem
	* Example: I had trouble going to bed early, so I [tried
		Melatonin](./reports.html#Melatonin), which pretty much
		solved my problem
	* Example: I had trouble biting my nails, so I started [cutting them regularly](./reports.html#Mostly-topping-to-Bite-My-Nails), which also pretty much solved my problem
	* Example: I used to have a problem with getting distracted by the internet during hours when I wanted to be working. I went to a place without internet, which made working easier.
11.	The benefits of small amounts of meditation are probably
	overstated, while the benefits of large amounts of
	meditation (north of 1 hour a day) are probably heavily
	underestimated. I have had [very good experiences with
	it](./reports.html#300-Hours-of-Meditation).
	*	The basic foundational activity before meditation is just
		doing nothing. It shouldn't be very hard to do, but it is.
12. The ability to form habits is powerful.
	* Establishing low-value low-difficulty habits intentionally can train this
		* Example: Eating a small bar of chocolate a day <!--TODO: find Romeo stevens talk where he talks about this-->
13. Trigger-Action plans. They're great.
14. Only consume media you actually enjoy consuming, not the media you brag about consuming in front of others
	* Seriously. If you don't enjoy the process, just don't do it.
15.	Instead of learning a language, learn a couple of poems. Most people
	don't actually manage to learn a second (or, outside English speaking
	countries, third) language. Also, most people can't recite a single poem,
	even though it's much much easier to learn than a whole language.
	* Bonus points for learning a poem that inspires you, so that you can recite it in situations of hopelessness
	* This also applies to songs
16. Use [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) for, well, anything
	* This includes learning poems, songs, random facts, formulae
	* I especially like reading textbooks and saving the formulae and definitions
		* Not only does one remember the the things themselves, but is also continually reminded of the underlying structure, so that it is slowly baked into the brain
17.	When trying to receive specific advice, look for people that had
	a problem similar (or identical) to yours, and find the methods that
	they used to solve their problem. If these methods don't work as well
	you as they did for them, continue searching
	* The more similar their constraints to yours, the better
	* This probably disqualifies this whole text, but whatever
18. Structured Procrastination <!--TODO: link--> might work for you. It does for me.
19.	Fight tooth and nail for Slack<!--TODO: link-->. FIRE<!--TODO:
	link-->, fewer addictions (even small ones like mindless internet
	browsing), no debt, fewer physical objects you own, and less
	social obligations are all instances of having a lot of slack.
	*	Example: I have a bad instance of completionism around
		media. Once I have started a particular piece of media
		(a podcast, a series, a blog), it feels bad to just not
		finish it. This is a lack of slack!
		*	I haven't solved the podcast problem yet, except
			being very strict about which podcasts I start
20. Don't destroy option value.
	*	Becoming enemies with people is an instance of destroying
		option value (you can become an enemy of your friend
		more easily than you can become a friend of your enemy)
	* Dying destroys a lot of option value.
	* Becoming irrational destroys option value (it's easier to
		become irrational when you're rational, than to become
		rational when you're irrational).
21.	There are two ways of living more: making your life longer and
	making your life feel longer.
	*	Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between how enjoyable an
		activity is and how long it feels like.
		*	Try to find activities that are at the pareto
			frontier of enjoyability and subjective length
			* Meditation is probably a good example for this
	*	Creating things probably feels longer than the same
		time spent consuming things
	* Doing new activies also feels longer than familiar ones <!--TODO: theoryengine post-->
22.	If you want to get into X, the best way of doing so is probably
	doing a little bit of X for a month, and then one week of X for
	6 or more hours a day
	* This probably works better for non-cognitive tasks
	* Unfortunately, you probably won't have the time for spending 6 hours a day on X for a week.
23.	If there is an item on this list that tells you to stop doing X,
	but you truly enjoy doing X, then disregard the advice.
24.	If you're writing a long commment on the internet, you're probably
	better off writing it in a local text editor and copy-pasting it
	once you're done. It has only happened to me a couple of times,
	but losing a long, detailed comment through a reload or browser
	crash or whatever was always frustrating.
25. Obvious computering advice
	* Make backups
		*	Ideally, use the 3-2-1 strategy (3 copies on the local
			drive, 2 more copies on separate drives, and 1
			copy on a remote server)
	* Use a password manager
		*	I prefer both remembering my passwords and using
			a password manager, in case something breaks
			irreparably
	* Use an adblocker
		*	People still don't do this. Don't be one of those
			people.
	* Touch typing reduces brain-to-screen viscosity
26. Kimchi is amazing. Try it.
	*	It's quite enjoyable to eat, but the real enjoyment
		comes after having eaten it. I feel very refreshed
		& alert.
	* I think it's also healthy?
27. Money is important. Treat is as such.
	*	I have the impression that many otherwise smart people
		have ideological hangups about money, seeing it as
		immoral and not worth thinking about. This seems
		both untrue and harmful – money is extremely useful,
		and having money is pretty important. <!--TODO: LW post about money-->
	*	Know how much you spend, on what, and what your longterm
		financial plan is.
28.	For some people, sometimes being able to ground out ones problems
	causally in the world (i.e. “Which gears-level processes lead to
	the situation I'm in, and which incentives pushed which people to
	create/exacerbate those problems?”) can help dissolve negative
	emotions around the problem.
	*	Related: Modeling other people as causal systems plays
		into this very well
29.	Vitamin C might cause kidney stones to happen more often. [You
	probably don't want to experience kidney
	stones](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gtGe8WkeFvqucYLAF/logarithmic-scales-of-pleasure-and-pain-rating-ranking-and "Logarithmic Scales of Pleasure and Pain: Rating, Ranking, and Comparing Peak Experiences Suggest the
Existence of Long Tails for Bliss and Suffering"). <!--TODO: better links for this-->
30. If you are about to start fighting someone, be aware that this happens. State it out loud: Does this mean we are now fighting? Surprisingly, this sometimes defuses the fight.
31. If you're already doing something unethical, it's better to be aware of that than to compartmentalize and push it away – for yourself *and* others.
32.	Don't invest money by buying diamonds. Humanity is able to create
	synthetic diamonds that are as big as natural ones,
	cleaner (fewer residual elements, e.g. nitrogen) and
	~10x cheaper<!--TODO: sources-->. It is easier to make
	synthetic diamonds dirtier than to clean natural ones. [De
	Beers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers) and other diamond
	companies have been combatting this by giving out certificates of
	authenticity – but the temptation to cheat on these is probably
	too high and this looks like a major market disequilibrium that
	will collapse at *some* point – I'm just not sure when (“The
	market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”).
	*	If you appreciate natural diamonds for their authenticity,
		then by all means, go ahead. But don't be disappointed
		when a years later, your friends can buy bigger diamonds
		with the same carbon atoms 10x cheaper<!--TODO: link
		Yudkowsky on "the same atoms"-->
