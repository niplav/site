Better Names for Things
------------------------

Although [linguistic
prescriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription)
is technically a cardinal sin, I sometimes make exceptions if a word
particularly annoys me. This is a list of such words and suggestions
for better naming of the concepts they describe.

### "Rationalism"

The name is already occupied by a philosophical tradition called
["rationalism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism) which has very
little relation to the collection of people on the internet usually called
"rationalists". Also, the name seems to be quite pretentious to outsiders.

<!--TODO: there was a post on LW about this instead being
"pragmatism". Look that up!-->

Alternatives:

*       "Mapmaking": Using "The map is not the territory.", related to
        practicality. Downside: also already taken.
*       [Metacognitive Movement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4E4zbHSmyuhkqgJmm/let-s-rename-ourselves-the-metacognitive-movement)

[Further discussion here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dq8rwmWXXQ4D4T6YD/should-we-stop-using-the-term-rationalist).

### "Anarcho-Capitalism"

The word "Anarchism" is strongly connected with left libertarian
anti-capitalist thought (such as described by Bakunin, Kropotkin and
Proudhon) throughout most of history and most of the world. Radical
supporters of capitalism describing themselves as anarchists seems to
be a historical anomaly, and they might want to find a name that clashes
less with already existing trains of political thought.

On the other hand, there has been a lot of debate about this perceived
clash of terminology and it seems quite unlikely to change in the
near future.

Alternatives:

* "Propertarianism"
* "Voluntaryism"
* "Voluntarism"

### "Animal Rights"

From a consequentialist perspective, rights are usually seen as
instrumental heuristics and not as terminal values. When people talk about
animal rights, they usually mean leaving animals alone in the context of
factory farming and opposing interventions in nature. However, [Tomasik
2017](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/ "The Importance of W
ild-Animal Suffering")
makes a striking case for intervening in nature due to the prevalence of
extreme suffering, usually including highly invasive measures which would
violate a naive concept of "animals rights". However, these interventions
would be designed to increase total animal welfare.

Alternatives:

* "Animal Welfare"

### "Patriarchy"

Some feminists today claim that the patriarchy hurts [both men *and*
women](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Patriarchy). However, the
word "patriarchy" strongly carries the connotation that men are solely
responsible for this, which seems not entirely clear.

Alternatives:

* ["Kyriarchy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy)
* "Screwed up state of gender relations"

### "Value Drift"

Most people understand an opposition "value drift" as a rejection of
moral development, and it's not clear where the difference between the
two lies. Perhaps there are different kinds of such drifts: "value
drift", "motivation drift", "discipline drift" etc.

Alternatives:

*       "Motivation Drift": This makes a clearer distinction between
        motivation and the values motivated about

### "Pick-Up Artistry"

Strictly speaking, the word "art" is generally overused and defiled by
using it to describe kitsch, skill or practice. I personally would prefer
it if people stopped using the word "art" to describe banal and common
things. "Pick-Up Artistry" falls into this category. It is a skill that
requires sometimes years of practice, but it is a fundamentally practical
and goal-oriented activity, unlike most (if not all) art.

Alternatives:

* "Pick-Up"
* "Game", but this one [suffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game) [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_\(hunting\)) [serious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_\(rapper\)) [overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/Game_\(Scientology\)) [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_\(grape\)) (Huh! I [lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_\(mind_game\))/won<!--TODO: link to tweet about MDMA and winning game--> it again!)

### "Sentience"

> In the philosophy of
[consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness),
sentience can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective
perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them,
"[qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)". […]
In the philosophies of animal welfare and rights, sentience implies the
ability to experience [pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure)
and [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering).

*— English Wikipedia, [“Sentience”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience), 2019*

Very often, the word "sentience" is used to refer to the ability to
feel pleasure or pain, or, to be more general, have experiences with a
[valence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)). However,
the strict philosophical definition of "sentience" does not necessarily
entail the ability to feel pleasure or pain, just that some qualia
can be experienced. Although it is very often assumed that sentience
necessarily entails pleasure and pain, it might still be worthwhile
making a distinction between the two.

> "Sentients" is usually defined as beings that are capable of
subjectively perceiving or feeling by means of the senses. This includes
not only beings capable of the feeling of being happy and/or unhappy,
but also includes beings just capable of perceiving things without having
any affective feeling. In principle, it is possible for some sentients
to be capable of perceiving the external world but without feeling
happy or unhappy. One could have sensations of perceiving different
colours without enjoying or disliking seeing them; one could have the
sensation of being touched or even being squeezed without feeling pain or
pleasure. Such non-affective sentients really do not have any positive
or negative welfare. Their welfare is necessarily zero, just like non-
sentients. Hence, for the purpose here, the important dividing line is
not between sentients and non-sentients, but between affective sentients
and non-affective beings (sentient or non-sentient).

*— Yew-Kwang Ng, [“Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering”](./doc/biology/welfare/towards_welfare_biology_evolutionary_economics_of_animal_consciousness_and_suffering_ng_1995.pdf) p. 4, 1995*

Thus, it seems desirable to differentiate between the ability to have
subjective experiences ("sentience") and the ability to have affective
subjective experiences.

Alternatives:

* "Affective sentience"

Personal proposals:

* "Valience" (the ability to have experiences with a valence component)

Naming ASCII Characters
------------------------

Programmers often have to use the ASCII special characters
`!"#\|%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~` and \`. However,
pronouncing/spelling out "exclamation mark" is cumbersome, which
made programmers introduce (or use) their own names for these
characters. [Urbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbit),
as always, [drives the idea to its logical
conclusion](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/hoon/stdlib/4h).

Let me propose some names, with the goal of selecting the most common
name for the character that is only one syllable long:

* \* star (splat)
* ? what
* \` tick
* ! bang
* . dot
* + plus
* ~ not
* < less
* > more
* @ at
* # hash
* / slash
* \ back (whack)
* | bar (or)
* & and
* " quote
* $ cash
* - dash

No individual names yet, also two syllables:

* \(\) paren
* \[\] bracket
* {} brace

Not sure:

* % per
* \_ score
* ^ up (hat, flex)
* ; then
* : so
* ' say
* = is

Asymmetries in Languages
-------------------------

### German

* German distinguishes between structural "same" ("das gleiche") and indexcial "same" (dasselbe")
* Wenn man das weibliche Gegenstück zum "Patriarchen" benennen will, welches Wort verwendet man? Üblicherweise ist die Antwort "die Matriarchin", aber das Wort ist redundant: das Geschlecht wird sowohl durch das "-in" Postfix als auch das Präfix "Matr-" signalisiert — aber das Wort "Matriarch" klingt bestenfalls merkwürdig. Was tun?
* Wenn man "0,5 Eier" sagt, ist "Eier" im Plural, aber bei "½ Ei" ist "Ei" im Singular. Wieso?
* Man kann zwischen "keine Pferde" und "kein Pferd" unterscheiden (Žižek approves), aber nicht zwischen "null Pferde" und "null Pferd".

### English

superstition, no substition or stition?

Only fishmongers, scaremongers, warmongers, cheesemongers, ironmongers,
costermongers and fearmongers?

myopia, no youropia, heropia etc.

paradox, but not paragnosis, paratechnē and paraëpistēmē

some Xs, every X?

* guy who says “beginning of this century” when referring to the aughts, and “last century” for events in the nineties
* guy who takes MDMA at a techno rave and says “so this is what it's all about”, but not just about raving culture, but, like, life in general
* guy who meets his spouse in the metaculus comments
* guy who, when he hears someone mention SARS, thinks of deep Q-learning
* guy who takes up daygame again because of the transferrable skills

* [Robert Fludd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fludd): "Fludd's own theory on the origin of all things posited that, instead of the Tria Prima, all species and things stemmed from first, dark Chaos, then divine Light which acted upon the Chaos, which finally brought forth the waters. This last element was also called the Spirit of the Lord"
