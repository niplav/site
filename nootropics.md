decided to log my nootropics usage and its effects.__

Nootropics
===========

Creatine
---------

[Examine](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/). I
follow the loading procedure detailed
[here](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/#NJj4E2e-do-i-need-to-load-creatine):

> [Creatine](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/) is a supplement that is known for having a 'loading' phase followed by a 'maintenance' phase. A typical creatine cycle has three parts to it.
>  
> * Take 20-25g (or 0.3g/kg) for 5-7 days (Loading)
> * Then take 5g daily for 3-4 weeks (Maintenance)
> * Take a week or two off creatine, and then repeat (Wash-out)

First dose was taken on 2023-01-06.

I'm especially interested in the effects of creatine on my
cognition (allegedly it increases IQ in vegetarians, and I'm a
[lacto-vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacto-vegetarianism)),
my exercising performance and my meditation ability.

Nicotine
---------

I started taking nicotine (in the form of nicotine chewing gum with 2mg of
active ingredient) in high-pressure situations (e.g. I'm procrastinating
on an important task and have anxiety around it, or during exams). So far,
it seems especially useful to break me out of a akratic rut.
