### Gwern.net

#### “Ordinary Life Improvements”

[Gwern 2019a](https://www.gwern.net/Notes#ordinary-life-improvements)

In the section "Ordinary Life Improvements" the first sentence read
"[It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over
time]{,smallcaps}, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to
look". The comma before "smallcaps" was misplaced.

#### “Why Correlation Usually ≠ Causation: Causal Nets Cause Common Confounding”

[Gwern 2019b](https://www.gwern.net/Causality)

* The wikipedia link for social engineering went to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)`, but it was intended to go to `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(political_science)`
* A period '.' was missing after "And we can draw on all sorts of knowledge to do better³"
* With "(despite increases in marijuana use not followed by any schizophrenia increases / hormone replacement therapy correlates with mortality reduction in women so it definitely helps and doesn’t hurt” etc." -> there was a missing parenthesis
* "surely this observations" -> should be "surely this observation"

#### “Embryo selection for intelligence”

[Gwern 2018](https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection)

* "The maxima is ~281" -> should be "maximum"

#### “Life Extension Cost-Benefits”

[Gwern 2019c](https://www.gwern.net/Longevity)

* "To go into some more detail about the dosing issue, ne of the more recent meta-analyses to discuss dose in connection with all-cause mortality" -> "ne" should be "one"

#### “The Melancholy of Subculture Society”

[Gwern 2019d](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society)

* "they seem the lowerf the more they insist that they are" -> "lowerf" should probably be "lower"

#### “Banner Ads Considered Harmful”

[Gwern 2020](https://www.gwern.net/Ads)

* "or visual web ads are more less intrusive than audio" -> "or visual web ads are less intrusive than audio"
* "then that suggests that eliminating ads entirely (going from 11% to 0%) to 0%" -> the second "0%" shouldn't be there
* "However, I believe it would be safe to say that the _n_s for the" -> malcompiled markdown for "_n_s"
* "from any section andnotjust from the top news and video" -> in quote should probably be "and not just"

#### “The Replication Crisis: Flaws in Mainstream Science”

[Gwern 2019e](https://www.gwern.net/Replication)

* "QUestionable Research Findings" -> "Questionable Research Findings"

#### “Open Questions”

[Gwern 2021a](https://www.gwern.net/Questions)

* "she doesn’t fit the usual fake profile of existing only like paper like the" -> should be "only on paper"
* "you can cross them with just about other" -> missing word "any"
* "best/​worst out of 1000 healthy peoplem" -> typo "peoplem"

#### “Internet Search Tips”

[Gwern 2022](https://www.gwern.net/Search)

* "a good reason—tt may actually contain the fulltext hidden" -> should be "it may actually"

#### “Death Note: L, Anonymity & Eluding Entropy”

[Gwern 2017](https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity)

* "demonstrated in such o exhaustive detail that the present writer" -> stray "o"

#### “Prediction Markets”

[Gwern 2019f](https://www.gwern.net/Prediction-markets)

* In the paragraph "I shorted 10 at 18% since I thought the true odds are more like" -> suddenly switched tense from past to present
* "which is misleading and even technically interpreted, would be torpedoed by Zerocoin" -> missing "if" between "even" and "technically"
* Header in the table for personal bets was broken, "My P B" and "et Position R" and "esult"
* From "everyone" downward in the table the date offered/expiration cells were broken
* "when I speculated on the identity of Mike Darwin‘s patron (above, ’Notes’)" -> it's now below
* List of heuristics started at 2, not at 1 (the one after "When we begin deciding what probability to give the prediction")
* "industry over the period from 2010 to 2010" -> maybe one of those numbers should be different
* "he had ~410 billion in 2000 but fell to 300 million" -> shouldn't be "~410 billion", Wikipedia says <!--TODO: link--> "In 2000, Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.6 billion"

* "especially from unreliable resources2." -> the "2" should probably be a "²"
* "Š igut et al 2017:" should be "Šigut et al 2017:"

### Reducing-suffering.org

#### “Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money”

[Tomasik 2016](https://reducing-suffering.org/why-activists-should-consider-making-lots-of-money/)

* ""Replaceability by Paul Christiano" was missing a quote
<!--
(https://reducing-suffering.org/vegans-should-not-eat-insects-a-reply-to-fischer-2016/) "Urban composters promote slow temperature composting" -> "slow" should be "low" (or [sic]),
(https://reducing-suffering.org/applied-welfare-biology-wild-animal-advocates-focus-spreading-nature/) The content of this section has moved to an upcoming article, which should be online by Nov./Dec. 2017." -> probably means [this article](https://reducing-suffering.org/food-waste), or at least something [in this section](https://reducing-suffering.org/#Food_scraps).
"4. Stronger rule of law may reduce environmental destruction, and poverty reduction tends to improve rule of law." -> But this is contradictory? Stronger rule of law would prevent the destruction of the rainforest, which (barring climate change) seems net negative, but you treat conservation as something positive here. Why? Possible typo/thinking error?
(https://reducing-suffering.org/wild-caught-fishing-affects-wild-animal-suffering/)
"fewer higher trohic levels" -> "fewer higher trophic levels"
(https://reducing-suffering.org/should-fishing-opponents-be-happy-about-overfishing/)
"to the detrmiment" -> "to the detriment"
(https://reducing-suffering.org/how-cattle-grazing-affects-pasture-productivity/)
"Early seral stages are usually marked by rapid growth and biomass biomass accumulation" -> biomass is doubled, possibly [sic]
"Yet, many have not reached the decertified stage" -> [sic], should probably be "desertified"
(https://reducing-suffering.org/how-rainforest-beef-production-affects-wild-animal-suffering/)
"Strictly comparing cow vs. insect neurons, we get something on the order of 10⁵ cow-years of suffering per insect-year of suffering." -> should be the other way around
(https://reducing-suffering.org/scenarios-for-very-long-term-impacts-of-climate-change-on-wild-animal-suffering/)
"I'll discount wild animals t years into the future by a probabilistic factor t^(-k) for k in (‑∞, 0]. To avoid having this curve explode near t = 0, I cap the value of this discount at 1 for t < 1. I choose k = -0.1" -> Typo, I think you wanted to say that k=0.1, since the '-' is already in the equation?
(https://reducing-suffering.org/microorganisms-wastewater-treatment/)
"This means too much too many 'nutrients' are being released back into the ecosystem, perhaps a stream." -> "too much too many" is probably a [sic]?
(https://reducing-suffering.org/dissolving-confusion-about-consciousness/)
"In opposition to property dualism, Eliezer Yudkowsky writes" -> I always understood that quote to be about epiphenomenalism, not property dualism (although I guess one could argue that they are the same)
(https://reducing-suffering.org/the-many-fallacies-of-dualism/)
"scentific" -> "scientific"
(https://longtermrisk.org/the-eliminativist-approach-to-consciousness/)
"thing (dis)being valued, consciousness" -> move "(dis)" one word forward
-->

#### “Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project”

[Tomasik 2015](https://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/).

Fixed a typo where in the section "Transhumanism" of the pdf version,
the text "Transhumanists recognize the importance of thinking about the
future ahead of time." was repeated.

### “Empirical evidence for the proposition that production based on exchange value has collapsed”

[Jehu 2018](https://therealmovement.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/empirical-evidence-for-the-proposition-that-production-based-on-exchange-value-has-collapsed/#comment-10324).

Fixed a typo where with "The inflation of the of wages from 1970 to
1980" the author meant "The inflation of wages from 1970 to 1980".

### “Urbit: A Solid-State Interpreter”

[Yarvin et al. 2016](https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf).

Fixed a typo on p. 17 where in "treats b and c is formulas", "is" should
have been be "as".
