### “Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project”

[Tomasik 2015](https://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/).

Fixed a typo where in the section "Transhumanism" of the pdf version,
the text "Transhumanists recognize the importance of thinking about the
future ahead of time." was repeated.

### “Ordinary Life Improvements”

[Gwern 2019](https://www.gwern.net/Notes#Ordinary-Life-Improvements).<!--TODO: check link-->

In the section "Ordinary Life Improvements" the first sentence read
"[It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over
time]{,smallcaps}, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to
look". The comma before "smallcaps" was misplaced.

Programming
