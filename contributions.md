### Contributions to Wikis

1. Contributions to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Niplav): Probably the most important things I've ever written; another brick in the Great Pyramid. Only possibly eclipsed by my writing ending up in the training corpus of some [foundation model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model).
2. Contributions to [Arbital](https://arbital.com/p/niplavyushtun/)
3. Contributions to the [LessWrong Tags Portal](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/niplav)

	1. In the section "Ordinary Life Improvements" the first sentence read "[It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over time]{,smallcaps}, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to look". The comma before "smallcaps" was misplaced.

	2.. A period '.' was missing after "And we can draw on all sorts of knowledge to do better³"
	3. With "(despite increases in marijuana use not followed by any schizophrenia increases / hormone replacement therapy correlates with mortality reduction in women so it definitely helps and doesn’t hurt” etc." -> there was a missing parenthesis

3. “Embryo selection for intelligence” [Gwern 2018](https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection)
	1. "The maxima is ~281" -> should be "maximum"

	1. "To go into some more detail about the dosing issue, ne of the more recent meta-analyses to discuss dose in connection with all-cause mortality" -> "ne" should be "one"
5. “The Melancholy of Subculture Society” [Gwern 2019d](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society)
	1. "they seem the lowerf the more they insist that they are" -> "lowerf" should probably be "lower"
6. “Banner Ads Considered Harmful” [Gwern 2020](https://www.gwern.net/Ads)
	1. "or visual web ads are more less intrusive than audio" -> "or visual web ads are less intrusive than audio"

	3. "However, I believe it would be safe to say that the _n_s for the" -> malcompiled markdown for "_n_s"
	4. "from any section andnotjust from the top news and video" -> in quote should probably be "and not just"
7. “The Replication Crisis: Flaws in Mainstream Science” [Gwern 2019e](https://www.gwern.net/Replication)

9. “Internet Search Tips” [Gwern 2022](https://www.gwern.net/Search)

	1. "demonstrated in such o exhaustive detail that the present writer" -> stray "o"
11. “Prediction Markets” [Gwern 2019f](https://www.gwern.net/Prediction-markets)
	1. In the paragraph "I shorted 10 at 18% since I thought the true odds are more like" -> suddenly switched tense from past to present
	2. "which is misleading and even technically interpreted, would be torpedoed by Zerocoin" -> missing "if" between "even" and "technically"
	3. Header in the table for personal bets was broken, "My P B" and "et Position R" and "esult"
	4. From "everyone" downward in the table the date offered/expiration cells were broken
	5. "when I speculated on the identity of Mike Darwin‘s patron (above, ’Notes’)" -> it's now below
	6. List of heuristics started at 2, not at 1 (the one after "When we begin deciding what probability to give the prediction")

1.  “Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money” [Tomasik 2016a](https://reducing-suffering.org/why-activists-should-consider-making-lots-of-money/)
	1. ""Replaceability by Paul Christiano" was missing a quote
2. “Vegans Should Not Eat Insects: A Reply to Fischer” [Tomasik 2017a](https://reducing-suffering.org/vegans-should-not-eat-insects-a-reply-to-fischer-2016/)
	1. "Urban composters promote slow temperature composting" -> "slow" should be "low" (or [sic])
3. “Applied Welfare Biology and Why Wild-Animal Advocates Should Focus on Not Spreading Nature” [Tomasik 2018a](https://reducing-suffering.org/applied-welfare-biology-wild-animal-advocates-focus-spreading-nature/)
	1. "The content of this section has moved to an upcoming article, which should be online by Nov./Dec. 2017." -> probably means [this article](https://reducing-suffering.org/food-waste), or at least something [in this section](https://reducing-suffering.org/#Food_scraps).
4. “How Wild-Caught Fishing Affects Wild-Animal Suffering” [Tomasik 2017b](https://reducing-suffering.org/wild-caught-fishing-affects-wild-animal-suffering/)
	1. "fewer higher trohic levels" -> "fewer higher trophic levels"
5. “Should Fishing Opponents Be Happy about Overfishing?” [Tomasik 2016b](https://reducing-suffering.org/should-fishing-opponents-be-happy-about-overfishing/)
	1. "to the detrmiment" -> "to the detriment"
6. “How Cattle Grazing Affects Insect Populations on Pasture Fields” [Tomasik 2019](https://reducing-suffering.org/how-cattle-grazing-affects-pasture-productivity/)
	1. "Early seral stages are usually marked by rapid growth and biomass biomass accumulation" -> biomass was doubled, possibly [sic]
	2. "Yet, many have not reached the decertified stage" -> [sic], should probably be "desertified"
7. “How Rainforest Beef Production Affects Wild-Animal Suffering” [Tomasik 2017c](https://reducing-suffering.org/how-rainforest-beef-production-affects-wild-animal-suffering/)
	1. "Strictly comparing cow vs. insect neurons, we get something on the order of 10⁵ cow-years of suffering per insect-year of suffering." -> should be the other way around

	1. "I'll discount wild animals t years into the future by a probabilistic factor t^(-k) for k in (‑∞, 0]. To avoid having this curve explode near t = 0, I cap the value of this discount at 1 for t < 1. I choose k = -0.1" -> Typo, I think he wanted to say that k=0.1, since the '-' is already in the equation

	1.  "This means too much too many 'nutrients' are being released back into the ecosystem, perhaps a stream." -> "too much too many" probably was a [sic]
