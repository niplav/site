### “Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive-Sum Project”

[Tomasik 2015](https://foundational-research.org/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/).

Fixed a typo where in the section "Transhumanism" of the pdf version,
the text "Transhumanists recognize the importance of thinking about the
future ahead of time." was repeated.

### “Ordinary Life Improvements”

[Gwern 2019](https://www.gwern.net/Notes#ordinary-life-improvements).

In the section "Ordinary Life Improvements" the first sentence read
"[It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over
time]{,smallcaps}, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to
look". The comma before "smallcaps" was misplaced.

Fixed a typo where with "The inflation of the of wages from 1970 to
1980" the author meant "The inflation of wages from 1970 to 1980".

[Yarvin et al. 2016](https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf).

Fixed a typo on p. 17 where in "treats b and c is formulas", "is" should
have been be "as".
