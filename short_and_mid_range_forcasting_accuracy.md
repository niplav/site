Short and Mid Range Forecasting Accuracy
========================================

[Probabilistic forecasting](https://en.wikiki_Probabilistic_forecasting)
that aggregates both [qualitative and quantitative
methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting#Qualitative_vs._quantitative_methods)
is a comparatively simple idea. Basically, one needs to have only very few tools at ones
disposal to being ready to start forecasting:

* View of belief as probabilistic (perhaps with some bayesian epistemology)
* Track records (grading results of forecasts using for example brier scores or log scores)
* Probability theory (a concept of probabilities, and maybe some simple probability distributions)

The [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) was invented
in 1950, [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem)
was first described in 1763, and [probability
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) was properly
invented at the beginning of the 18th century.

However, attempting to use forecasting to seriously determine the
probability of future events, training & selecting people for their
forecasting ability and creating procedures that incorporate both
intuition-based and model-based predictions have only been around since
the mid 1980's<!--TODO: citation needed-->, mostly popularized by the
work of [Philip Tetlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehpilp_E._Tetlock).

Since then, forecasting has slowly but surely matured from "X is going
to happen because my intuition/divine revelation told me so" to "my
probability distribution on the outcome of this random variable is
an X distribution", or alternatively "I assign a probability of X%
to this event".

However, since this kind of forecasting is relatively recent, information
about the accuracy of long-range forecasting is basically non-existent:

<!--TODO: quote the findings from the OpenPhil report here-->

In this text, I will try to look at the accuracy of short-term and
mid-term forecasting, which may shine some light on the relation between
the range of forecasts and their accuracy in general. The range of a
forecast is defined as the length of the timespan between the forecast
and the resolution of the forecast. Keeping with the report by the Open
Philanthropy Project<!--TODO: link-->, I will define short-term forecasts
as forecasts with a range of less than a year, mid-range forecasts as
forecasts with a range between 1 and 10 years, and long-term forecasts
as forecasts with a range of more than 10 years.

Fortunately, for short- and mid-range forecasts, two easily accessible
sources of forecasts and their resolutions are available online: The
two forecasting websites [PredictionBook](https://predictionbook.com)
and [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com).

<!--
Make a point here that making forecasts is one of the best existing
practical method of rationality verification & exercises:

Distinction between {probabilistic,non-probabilistic}
{model-based,intuition-based} forecasting

<!--
Tetlock-style forecasting is "Worse is Better"
If we can't develop explicit numerical models, why
not train people in becoming good at estimating the future,
but this time with probabilistic estimates?
