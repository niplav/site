Getting an Overview Over Everything
-----------------------------------

Many people want to learn everything ([Drexler
2009](http://metamodern.com/2009/05/27/how-to-learn-about-everything/),
[Young
2008](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/06/12/the-goal-of-learning-everything/)).
This poses a significant challenge, and begins with the problem of
figuring out what “everything” is supposed to contain.

One possible method one could use to get
an overview of everything is to use [Wikipedia's
contents:Outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines):
it contains a list of all
[outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)) on wikipedia,
and is well structured. Wikipedia is generally concise and complete
enough to provide a sufficient overview over a topic (see [Tomasik
2017](https://foundational-research.org/education-matters-for-altruism/#Taking_the_big_picture_Textbooks_review_articles_and_Wikipedia)).
To read this collection of outlines completely, one could use the
following method:

Read [Wikipedia's
contents:Outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines)
from top to bottom. If a link is a link to a wikipedia article, open it
and read it, without opening any further links. If a link leads to an
outline, open the link and recursively apply the same procedure to the
outline. If an article is opened a second time, it can be discarded. Lists
can also be ignored.

This method results in a corpus of considerable size. (TODO: how much text?)
