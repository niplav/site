Getting an Overview Over Everything
-----------------------------------

Many people want to learn everything ([Drexler
2009](http://metamodern.com/2009/05/27/how-to-learn-about-everything/),
[Young
2008](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/06/12/the-goal-of-learning-everything/)).
This poses a significant challenge, and begins with the problem of
figuring out what “everything” is supposed to contain.

One possible method one could use to get
an overview of everything is to use [Wikipedia's
contents:Outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines):
it contains a list of all
[outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)) on Wikipedia,
and is well structured. Wikipedia is generally concise and complete
enough to provide a sufficient overview over a topic (see [Tomasik
2017](https://foundational-research.org/education-matters-for-altruism/#Taking_the_big_picture_Textbooks_review_articles_and_Wikipedia)).
To read this collection of outlines completely, one could use the
following method:

Read [Wikipedia's
contents:Outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines)
from top to bottom. If a link is a link to a Wikipedia article, open it
and read it, without opening any further links. If a link leads to an
outline, open the link and recursively apply the same procedure to the
outline. If an article is opened a second time, it can be discarded. Lists
can also be ignored.

This method results in a corpus of considerable size. (TODO: how much text?)

Approach Anxiety
----------------

I had very big problems when trying to overcome approach anxiety. Since
this seems to be a common problem, it may be worth it to share a method
that was successful for me to become more comfortable with it. To make
progress on that front, I set a goal for several weeks in advance,
similar to this:

* 1st week: Ask 1 guy a day for his number
* 2nd week: Ask 2 guys for their numbers
* 3rd week: Ask 3 guys for their numbers
* 4th week: Ask 3 guys and 1 girl for their numbers
* 5th week: Ask 2 guys and 1 girl for their numbers
* 6th week: Ask 1 guy and 2 girls for their numbers
* 7th week: Ask 3 girls for their numbers

If I failed in a week, I precommitted to donating a certain amount like
5€ to an effective charity.

In contrast to the other methods used and advertised by people who cold
approach, this worked quite well. After the first 4 weeks, I took 1 week
off, but went back to approaching the week after.

This, of course, only can work if one is able to ask men for their
numbers. For a reason that eludes me, this is easier for me than
approaching women, though the gap is shrinking with exposure.

Converging Preference Utilitarianism
------------------------------------

One problem with preference utilitarianism (TODO: Wikipedia link here) is
the difficulty of aggregating and comparing preferences interpersonally,
as well as a critique that some persons have very altruistic and others
very egoistic preferences.

### Method

A possible method of trying to resolve this is to try to hypothetically
calculate the aggregate preferences of all persons in the following
way: For every existing person pₐ, this person learns about the
preferences of all other persons pₙ. For each pₙ, pₐ learns about
their preferences and experiences pₙ's past sensory inputs. pₐ then
updates their preferences according to this information. This process
is repeated until the maximal difference between preferences has shrunk
to a certain threshold.

### Variations

One possible variation in the procedure is between retaining knowledge
about the identity of pₐ, the person aggregating the preferences. If
this were not done, the result would be very akin to the Rawlsian Veil
of Ignorance (TODO: Wikipedia link here).

Another possible variation could be not attempting to achieve convergence,
but only simply iterating the method for a finite amount of times. Since
it's not clear that more iterations would contribute towards further
convergence, maybe 1 iteration is desirable.

### Problems

This method has a lot of ethical and practical problems.

#### Assumptions

The method assumes a bunch of practical and theoretical premises,
for example that preferences would necessarily converge upon
experiencing and knowing other persons qualia and preferences.
It also assumes that it is in principle possible to make a person
experience other persons qualia.

#### Sentient Simulations

Since each negative experience would be experienced by every person
at least one time, and negative experiences could considered to have
negative value, calculating the converging preferences would be unethical
in practice (TODO: link Tomasik's considerations on sentient simulations).
