Content
=======

This is the website of niplav. It contains texts on different topics,
including (but not limited to) forecasting, futurism, unusual social
behavior and philosophy, as well as translations and transcriptions
of different texts, chronological archives of blogs and programming
projects.

More information about the website and its author can be
found on the [about](./about.html) page, for recent additions
and changes, see the [changelog](./changelog.html), and the
corresponding [RSS feed](https://niplav.substack.com/feed) or
[substack](https://niplav.substack.com/)[^1].

[^1]: Feeds like RSS/Atom/Substack are not a great fit for what I'm trying to do here, since [I'm not writing a blog](./about.html#Not_Really_a_Blog) and instead focus on [long content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content). But demand was high.

I [can be hired](./services.html) to investigate research questions, write
code, design and execute experiments, analyze data and make predictions.

#### Programming & Computer Science

> “Stepchild”! That one word says it all. There’s a whole
Tolstoyan novel in it, or maybe a Henry James, or at least a Grimm
Brothers fairy tale. Computer science is the poor relation, the orphan,
the foundling—taken in by a grand family but never taken seriously,
never allowed to forget its doubtful origins. Or else computer science is
the arriviste, the rich American cousin with too much cash and too little
taste, who tears down the mossy old manse and puts up a spiffy new house
designed by Frank Gehry. Or do we have a tale of sibling rivalry—the two
children with different visions of the future for the family firm, neither
of whom can ever feel secure in the love of a cold and distant parent?

##### Pick-Up

> The American girl is well acquainted with her body’s seductive
capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes,
and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts,
the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs and she shows
all this and does not hide it. She knows it lies in clothes: in bright
colors that awaken primal sensations, and in designs that reveal the
temptations of the body— and in American girls these are sometimes live,
screaming temptations! Then she adds to all this the fetching laugh,
the naked looks, and the bold moves, and she does not ignore this for
one moment or forget it!

Transcriptions

Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/ "Start at the Beginning")
because most blogs are not organized by topic (tagging/categorization
systems don't count, don't be ridiculous). But blog archives are
usually hard to navigate and it is often difficult to keep track of my
current position in the blog (especially with yearly/monthly WordPress
archives). To salvage this, I scrape blog archives and arrange them
chronologically.

* [Bit-Player Posts Chronological Index](./bp_chrono.html)
* [Overcoming Bias Posts Chronological Index](./ob_chrono.html)
* [Shtetl Optimized Posts Chronological Index](./so_chrono.html)
* [The Real Movement Posts Chronological Index](./trm_chrono.html)

Programming

### Media Consumption

I sometimes write reviews of things I have watched/read.

* [Text Reviews](./text_reviews.html)

The following is four lists on the content I consume. The content listed
there is a fairly big subset of what I actually read/listen to/watch,
but not complete. I also don't remember everything from these perfectly.
