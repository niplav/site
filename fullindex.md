[^1]: Feeds like RSS/Atom/Substack are not a great fit for what I'm trying to do here, since [I'm not writing a blog](./about.html#Not_Really_a_Blog) (it's not chronological, i.e. the "log" part is missing) and instead focus on [long content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content). But demand was high.

#### Programming & Computer Science

> “Stepchild”! That one word says it all. There’s a whole
Tolstoyan novel in it, or maybe a Henry James, or at least a Grimm
Brothers fairy tale. Computer science is the poor relation, the orphan,
the foundling—taken in by a grand family but never taken seriously,
never allowed to forget its doubtful origins. Or else computer science is
the arriviste, the rich American cousin with too much cash and too little
taste, who tears down the mossy old manse and puts up a spiffy new house
designed by Frank Gehry. Or do we have a tale of sibling rivalry—the two
children with different visions of the future for the family firm, neither
of whom can ever feel secure in the love of a cold and distant parent?

Von dem Sichgeistigen des Lebens Jahre zählen.

##### Pick-Up

> The American girl is well acquainted with her body’s seductive
capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes,
and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts,
the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs and she shows
all this and does not hide it. She knows it lies in clothes: in bright
colors that awaken primal sensations, and in designs that reveal the
temptations of the body— and in American girls these are sometimes live,
screaming temptations! Then she adds to all this the fetching laugh,
the naked looks, and the bold moves, and she does not ignore this for
one moment or forget it!

*—[Sayyid Qutb ash-Shaheed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb), [“The America I Have Seen”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_America_I_Have_Seen) p. 16, 1951*

neural correlates of cognitive/emotional phenomena. Most of those studies,
undoubtedly, are Bad.

### Other

> In einer Ecke des Zimmers lag auf dem Fußboden all das in einem
Haufen, was von gröberer Art und nicht würdig war, auf den Tischen zu
liegen. Was sich aber in dem Haufen befand, war schwer zu bestimmen, denn
er war mit solch einem Übermaß von Staub bedeckt, daß die Hände eines
jeden, der ihn berührte, sich wie mit Handschuhen überzogen hätten;
mehr als anderes fielen ein abgebrochenes Stück von einem Holzspaten,
das dort hervorragte, und eine alte Stiefelsohle auf.

Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/ "Start at the Beginning")
because most blogs are not organized by topic (tagging/categorization
systems don't count, don't be ridiculous). But blog archives are
usually hard to navigate and it is often difficult to keep track of my
current position in the blog (especially with yearly/monthly WordPress
archives). To salvage this, I scrape blog archives and arrange them
chronologically.

The following is four lists on the content I consume. The content listed
there is a fairly big subset of what I actually read/listen to/watch,
but not complete. I also don't remember everything from these perfectly.
