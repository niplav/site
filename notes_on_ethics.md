Notes on Ethics
================

Approval-Attractors of Ethical Agents
-------------------------------------

Basically: When I'm angry or stressed, I would like to defer to
versions of myself that are relaxed & calm. If we draw a network of
these deferrings, there are probably some attractors.

What Use Ethics For?
---------------------

Everyday life, or problems that arise in the limit?

C.f. High Energy Ethics.

Humans Embody a Value Discovery Process
----------------------------------------

The Two Urgent Problems are: How Don't We Die and How Do We Become Happy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Very Subjective Ranking of Types of Ethical Theories
-------------------------------------------------------

Consequentialisms, Contractualism, Deontology, Virtue Ethics

I Care About Ethical Decision Procedures
-----------------------------------------

Or, why virtue ethics feels misguided.

What Is Wrong With the Unwilling Organ-Donor Thought Experiment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Problems with game-theoretical ethical intuitions.

Better framing: Create universe, make decision, destroy universe after
payoff time.

For most people, there's a point where they kill the unwilling organ
donor, so we're basically haggling over the price. Maybe just a Sorites
paradox?

Why Death is Bad
-----------------

Under moral uncertainty with evolving preferences, you want to keep
options open, but death closes all options but one, potentially losing
a lot of future value.

In a sense, it's unfair towards all other ethical systems you embody
to kill yourself.

Possible Surprising Implications of Moral Uncertanity
------------------------------------------------------

Preserving languages & biospheres might be really important, if the
continuity of such processes is morally relevant.

We should try to be careful about self-modification, lest we fall into
a molochian attractor state we don't want to get out of. Leave a line
of retreat in ideology-space!

The Repugnant Conclusion Implies Many or Only One Moral Patient
----------------------------------------------------------------

Diminishing or increasing returns on investments for well-being
of a single agent?

If we're really lucky, initially there are increasing returns, but at
some point they start diminishing.
