I learned of the diamond-square algorithm by reading through the archives
of [Chris Wellon's blog](https://nullprogram.com/), specifically his post
on [noise fractals](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2007/11/20) and terrain
generation. The algorithm is a fairly simple and old one (dating back
to the 80s), but not being interested in graphics or game programming,
I shelved it as a curiosity.

However, a while later I needed a way to generate high-dimensional
landscapes for [a simulation](./toy_ai_takeoff_model.html), and
remembered the algorithm, I felt like I could contribute something here
by generalizing the algorithm to produce landscapes in an arbitrary number
of dimensions, and that this would be a fun challenge to sharpen my (then
fairly weak) Python and [numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)
skills.

Description
------------

The original (2-dimensional) diamond-square algorithm, in its simplest
form, starts with a `$2^n+1 \times 2^n+1$` grid of numbers.

It is easiest explained visually:

![](./img/diamond/diamond_square.png)

1. Either a user or the algorithm itself assigns the four corners some values, which can be random.
2. In the __diamond step__ after that, the value in the middle of the grid is determined as the average of the four values in the corners, plus a random value.
3. Next, the middle value every "face" of the grid is determined by the average of the three values in orthogonal directions plus a random value—the __square step__.
4. The grid is broken down into four sub-grids, and each sub-grid undergoes the __diamond step__ and the __square step__. The only difference is in the square step: If a point on the grid lies at the face of two sub-grids, it receives the average of all four orthogonal points.
5. The algorithm terminates if each sub-grid is of size `$1 \times 1$`.

For `$n$` dimensions, do that, just higher-dimensional.

We start by initializing an n-dimensional space with zeros, and the
corners with random values:

	def create_space(dim, size, minval, maxval, factor):
		space=np.zeros([size]*dim)
		corners=(size-1)*get_cornerspos(dim)
		space[*(corners.T)]=np.random.randint(minval, maxval, size=len(corners))

Here, `get_cornerspos` is just the one-liner
`return np.array(list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=dim)))`.

We then intialize the variable `offsets`, and call the recursive
diamond-square algorithm:

		offsets=[np.array([0]*dim)]
		return ndim_diamond_square_rec(space, dim, size, offsets, minval, maxval, factor)

### Diamond

The diamond step of the algorithm starts out with the base case: If the
space is only one element big, we return and do nothing (assuming the
value has been filled in):

	def ndim_diamond_square_rec(space, dim, size, offsets, minval, maxval, factor):
		if size<=1:
			return

We also have to update the size of any axis in the space (*not* the size
of the space itself), we are halving this every recursive call.

		nsize=size//2

Now we come to `offsets`. Remember above when after the first square
step, we moved into a diamond step on the smaller squares? `offsets`
describes where the "left lower corner" of those smaller squares is. We
initialized it with zeros, that way we start in a definite corner.

### Square

Code [here](code/diamond/ndim_diamond_square.py). I think this is probably
the 2nd-most beautiful code I've ever written, just after [this absolute
smokeshow](./99_problems_klong_solution.html#P25__Generate_a_random_permutation_of_the_elements_of_a_list).
