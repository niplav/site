Introduction
-------------

I learned of the diamond-square algorithm by reading through the archives
of [Chris Wellon's blog](https://nullprogram.com/), specifically his post
on [noise fractals](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2007/11/20) and terrain
generation. The algorithm is a fairly simple and old one (dating back
to the 80s), but not being interested in graphics or game programming,
I shelved it as a curiosity.

However, a while later I needed a way to generate high-dimensional
landscapes for [a simulation](./toy_ai_takeoff_model.html), and
remembered the algorithm, I felt like I could contribute something here
by generalizing the algorithm to produce landscapes in an arbitrary number
of dimensions, and that this would be a fun challenge to sharpen my (then
fairly weak) Python and [numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)
skills.

Description
------------

The original (2-dimensional) diamond-square algorithm (in its simplest
form) starts with a `$2^n+1 \times 2^n+1$` array of numbers.
