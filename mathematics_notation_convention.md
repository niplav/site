Schein von ihm schwindet.

*‚Äî Walter Benjamin, ‚ÄúGoethes Wahlverwandschaften‚Äù, 1925*

### Basics

* Use `$:=$` for assignment, not `$\rightarrow$` or `$\leftarrow$`
* When denoting choosing elements from a set based on some criterion, use the bar |: `$\{x|x \in P(x) \land \forall y \in S: x \succ y\}$` (some people use a colon)
* Usually, with `$\bigcup/\bigvee/\sum/\prod$` etc, use `$i$` and `$j$` as the variables. If there are more, use `$i_1, i_2, \dots$`.
* A variable with the name "abcd" is written as `$\text{abcd}$`, `$abcd$` is the product of four variables `$a, b, c$` and `$d$`.
* `$0 \in \mathbb{N}$`, `$\mathbb{N}^+:=\mathbb{N}\backslash \{0\}$`.
	* First of all, [there's an ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) (ISO-80000-2) that states that `$0 \in \mathbb{N}$`. I know it's kind of dumb, but standards are nice & there for a reason.
	* `$(\mathbb{N}, +)$` and `$(\mathbb{N}^+, \cdot)$` are both commutative [monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid).
	* `$(\mathbb{N}, +, \cdot)$` is a semiring.
	* `$(\mathbb{N}^+, +, \cdot)$` is‚Ä¶nothing in particular?
		* `$\cdot$` distributes over `$+$`
		* No identity for `$+$`, so it can't be a [rng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rng_\(algebra\)) or a [semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semiring)
		* Associativity and commutativity are given for both `$+$` and `$\cdot$`
		* Neither have inverses
		* Only `$\cdot$` has an identity, so it can't be a [near-ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-ring) (but we also can't make `$(\mathbb{N}^+, \cdot, +)$` a rng or semiring because `$+$` doesn't distribute over `$\cdot$`)
	* Therefore, because `$(\mathbb{N}, +, \cdot)$` is the nicer structure, `$0 \in \mathbb{N}$`.
	* (I'm not super confident about the arguments above, maybe I missed a structure. If so, please tell me!)
* Setting operator precedence and passing arguments to functions is done with parentheses `$()$`, sets are denoted using `$\{\}$`, and `$[]$` is sometimes used in the context of statistics (variance of a variable, mean of a variable, and so on). These are not mixed.
* `$[n] = \{x \in \mathbb{N} | 1 \le x \le n \}$` for `$n \in \mathbb{N}$`.
* For function definitions, use `$\mapsto$` instead of `$\rightarrow$`, e.g. `$f: ‚Ñù^n \mapsto ‚Ñù$` instead of `$f: ‚Ñù^n \rightarrow ‚Ñù$`<!--TODO: bad! bad! think of better option-->
* In multiplication of reals (and maybe complex numbers), I prefer central dots `$a \cdot b \cdot c$`, and *sometimes* concatenation `$abcd$`. Rarely asterisks `$a * b * c * d$`, but I try to avoid them.
* Words
	* Instead of [__"numerator"__/__"denominator"__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction) I instead use __"upper number"__/__"lower number"__
	* A function `$f(x)=x^p$` is __"quadratic"__ iff `$p=2$`, and __"radical"__ iff `$p \in (0,1)$`

### Set Theory

* Clearly differentiate between stating something being a proper subset or not: only use `$A \subset B$` if definitely `$A \not =B$`, otherwise write `$A \subseteq B$`.
* Set difference is written with a backslash `$\backslash$`, not with a minus `$-$`.
* If e is not an element of S, then `$e \not \in S$` (and not something like `$e \in' S$`).
* The size of a set `$A$` is `$|A|$`, not `$\#(A)$`

### Logic

* Use `$\Rightarrow$` or `$\Leftarrow$` for implication and `$\Leftrightarrow$` for the biconditional instead of `$\leftarrow$` or `$\rightarrow$` and `$\leftrightarrow$`.

### Probability Theory and Statistics

* I write the expectation of the probability distribution `$X$` as `$\mathbb{E}[X]$` and the variance of `$X$` as `$\mathbb{V}[X]$`. Unfortunately, `$\mathbb{C}$` is already taken for the complex numbers, so I am forced to write `$\text{cov}[X,Y]$` for the covariance, and `$\text{cor}[X,Y]$` for the correlation.

### Game Theory

(Or social choice theory/decision theory/utility theory‚Ä¶)

* Some people use `$P, R, I$` instead of `$\prec, \preceq, \sim$`. I often don't.
* As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Maximin), the term "maximin" refers to the strategy of maximizing one's own minimum payoff in non-zero-sum games, while "minimax" is the strategy of minimizing the opponent's maximum payoff in zero-sum games
	* In zero-sum games, minimizing the opponent's maximum payoff is equivalent to maximizing one's own minimum payoff
	* This is unfortunately asymmetric: What term would we use if we wanted to minimize our own maximum?
		* Looking at this symmetrically, it would create a set of strategies (some nonsensical):

<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>(Optimizing one's own value)</td>
		<td>Maximum</td>
		<td>Minimum</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>maximize</td>
		<td>maximax</td>
		<td>maximin</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>minimize</td>
		<td>minimax</td>
		<td>minimin</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

----

<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>(Optimizing the other player's value)</td>
		<td>Maximum</td>
		<td>Minimum</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>maximize</td>
		<td>maxmaxi</td>
		<td>maxmini</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>minimize</td>
		<td>minmaxi</td>
		<td>minmini</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(This is *not* the terminology I will use, but I would if I were brave enough)

Things I Would Like To Do But I'm Not Brave Enough
---------------------------------------------------

* Use the generalized everything
	* Write the first/second/third and so on [moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_\(mathematics\)) as `$\mathbb{M_{1}}, \mathbb{M_{2}}, \mathbb{M_{3}}$`.
	* Only use the [generalized mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_mean).
	* Only refer to the Euclidean/Manhattan/max-norm with their respective `$p$`-norm.
* Use a `$\newcommand{\bigplus}{\mathop{\Large+\normalsize}} \bigplus_{i \in I}V_i$` and `$\newcommand{\bigdot}{\mathop{\Large‚Ä¢\normalsize}} \bigdot_{i \in I}V_i$` or `$\newcommand{\bigmult}{\mathop{\Large*\normalsize}} \bigmult_{i \in I}V_i$` instead of `$\sum_{i \in I} V_i$` and `$\prod_{i \in I} V_i$`.<!--TODO: LW link-->
* [This notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck) for logarithms, exponents and roots.
* Start with the integers `$\mathbb{Z}$`, and then specify when one wants only the positive numbers (`$\mathbb{Z}^+$`), the positive numbers with 0 (`$\mathbb{Z}^+_0$`), the negative numbers (`$\mathbb{Z}^-$`) and the negative numbers with 0 (`$\mathbb{Z}^-_0$`). That would be much nicer than using `$\mathbb{N}$`, since `$\mathbb{Z}$` is a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/commutative_ring) under addition and multiplication.
* Treat `$-$` and `$+$` as [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) operators for making expressions negative and positive, and sign flipping being done by explicitely multiplying with `$-1$`.
	* Alternatively, use the same notation as for the [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate).
* Use more different symbols from many different scripts. Sure, „Çà for the [Yoneda embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_lemma) and –® for the [Tate-Shafarevich group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate-Shafarevich_group) or the [Dirac comb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_comb) are cute, but what about ‡Æá, ·ö†, ‡Ωß, ‡≤¶, ñ§∂ ,·ïö and the entire [Yi script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_script)? One might want to object that these are hard to remember and therefore pronounce correctly, which is one of the reasons I don't use them. But on the other hand, one could focus on one script at a time, making it easier to learn the different symbols, especially if they are mostly used in text.

Things I'm Unsure About
------------------------

* Basically every usage of `$\ell$` feels weird to me (except for the `$\ell_p$` norm and `$\ell^p$` space maybe). It often seems too important/out of place for a simple variable (or, *god forbid*, an index).
