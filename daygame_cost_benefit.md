Cost
----

Daygame has many different costs: opportunity costs<!--TODO: wiki link-->
from the time spent approaching and dating women who then flake (one could
be doing better things in the same time, like pursuing other hobbies,
learning a language or musical instrument), mental strain from approach
anxiety, and simply the cost of paying for dates.

### Approaching Opportunity Cost

### Dating Opportunity Cost

### Mental Cost (or Benefit?)

### Paying for Dates

Benefit
-------

### Value of Having Sex

#### Value of the Sex Itself

#### A Sense of Pride and Accomplishment

#### Long-term Partners

### Flowthrough Benefits

Conclusion
----------

This way, we can calculate the optimal number of approaches and the
cumulative dollar value of these approaches:

	vals::{benefit(x)-cost(x)}'!10000
	*>vals
	vals@*>vals
