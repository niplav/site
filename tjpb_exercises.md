> __[The Jazz Piano
Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jazz_Piano_Book) by [Mark
Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levine_\(musician\)) is a jazz
piano textbook (who knew!). Because it's very useful to regularly practice
voicings, scales etc, this page collects the exercises from that book.__

Exercises for “The Jazz Piano Book”
===================================

Exercises
----------

### Chapter One

<!--
> The chart that follows shows all the intervals, both ascending
and descending, as they occur in tunes from the standard jazz
repertoire. […] Play each example and *sing* the interval. […]
Listen carefully to all the voicings in the examples.

*– p. 1*

I usually just hit a random note on the keyboard and try to sing the
next interval starting from that note, iterating through the intervals.

<!--TODO: Image of all possible intervals here-->

> Practice singing the intervals, both ascending and descending. Sing
the melody, or "head," of standards, bebop, and other jazz tunes while
listening to records.

*– p. 9*

> Play the major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads in all keys
and all inversions.

*– p. 12*

I usually follow the cycle of fiths.

### Chapter 2

> Memorize the II-V-I progression in every key. Go through all twelve
keys saying the II-V-I chords aloud both sitting at, and away from,
the piano. Make a mantra of it until you have the progressions
memorized. *Always practice everything in every key*.

*– p. 16*

### Chapter 3

> Practice playing the II-V-I in both positions through all twelve keys,
around the cycle of fifths. Analyze tunes by chord type – is each
chord a II, V, or I chord?

*– p. 19*

### Chapter 4

Not in the book: Play all voicings of all sus (卣) chords where the
third has been voiced (see Figure 4-5). Try to get a feel for what they
sound like.

Play the Phyrgian chord in all keys, and resolve it to the corresponding
Δ chord (see Figure 4-7).

> Go through tunes in *The New Real Book* and *The World's Greatest Fake
Book*, reharmonizing II-V progressions using sus and Phrygian chords.
