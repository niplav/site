> __Summary of a longer investigation into [inconsistent
preferences](./turning.html) and how to resolve them. I investigate two
different ways of representing inconsistent preferences, two different
methods for resolving them into consistent preferences, how these perform
on seven criteria, and how two of those criteria are incompatible. I
conclude by connecting the question to ontological crises, and offer
some ideas for further research in the area.__

Preagents and Value Formation
==============================

Introduction
-------------

### Motivation

If we assume that [there is a "natural" structure for
preferences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/suxvE2ddnYMPJN9HD), then
I find it likely to assume that cognitive systems, as they develop,
might not have preferences in that structure.

Therefore it is useful to examine procedures to transform preferences
that don't have this "natural" structure into ones that do.
