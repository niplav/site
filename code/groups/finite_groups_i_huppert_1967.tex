\section{Preface}

When I began the preparations for this book in 1958, it seemed possible to
develop a nearly complete description of the theory of the structure of
finite groups in one volume. The sudden development experienced by this
theory (the bibliography gives an impression of this development) has
made this goal impossible to attain. This first volume contains, next to
basic terminology, the theory of nilpotent, $p$-nilpotent and decomposable
%TODO: "auflösbar" <-> "decomposable"?
groups as well as common representation theory.
%TODO: "gewöhnliche Darstellungstheorie" <-> "common representation theory"?
