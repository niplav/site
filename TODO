	Abstinence from Masturbation and Success from Cold Approach
		Abstract
			Motivation, Examples for claim
			Precommitment (H₀):
			"There is no statistically significant difference in success from cold approach before and after long term abstinence from masturbation."
		Method
			≥90 days of masturbation abstinence,
			Approach 100 women & 100 men (flipping) with
			"Hey, I know this is really spontaneous, but
			I just saw you and thought you were really
			attractive. Would you like to go on a date
			with me?"
			7 days daily masturbation
			Again, approach 100 women & 100 men (flipping) with
			"Hey, I know this is really spontaneous, but
			I just saw you and thought you were really
			attractive. Would you like to go on a date
			with me?"
		Results Analysis
			Does the hypothesis hold up?
			Make nice bargraphs & so on
		Problems
			Approaching of men/women I find attractive, not objective measure
			Different perception of attractiveness before&after masturbation
			Different settings/clothing/weather
		Conclusion
