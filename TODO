Using Venn Diagrams to Visualize Conceptions of Intelligence, Consciousness and Sentience
	5 Classes:
	• Intelligent
	• Sentient
	• Conscious
	• Information-processing
	• Optimzing
	Descriptions of terms (short, and only gesturing towards a definition):
		• Information-Processing (I-P): Complex internal state,
			responding to stimuli, processes information (duh!)
			Example: Computer
			Counter-example: Empty space
		• Intelligent (I): Internal model of the world, optimizes
			a goal, makes plans and executes them.
			Example: Adult human, artificial intelligence
			Counter-example: Tree
		• Conscious (C): Has internal self-model, passes mirror test
			(or similar test), can distinguish "world" and "self"
			Example: Myself
			Counter-example: P-Zombie
		• Sentient (S): Can experience valence qualia
			Example: Myself
			Counter-example: P-Zombie
		• Optimizing (O): Optimizes a given goal
			Example: Evolution, Paperclip-maximizer
			Counter-example: A piece of paper
	Notation: Typical for Venn diagram, but if two classes
	(e.g. Intelligent and Conscious), it is written as I=C in
	the circle.
	If a class doesn't mean anything (e.g. Sentient), it can be
	written as ¬S in the class it collapses into. If no such class exists, it
	can be written outside of all classes, also as ¬S.
