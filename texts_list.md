> __Texts I have read since May 2017.__

List of Texts I have Read
==========================

These are the texts I have read since May 2017 (sorted by starting date,
newest additions first). The definition of "text" is *very* broad here,
and includes many different types of texts, from 2-line poems to a 4000
page FAQ (which I only read the first half of). I did not include reddit
comments or tweets, because that would be too extensive.

A '\*' prefix signifies I'm still reading the
text, a '|123' prefix shows I abandoned reading the text at page 123.
