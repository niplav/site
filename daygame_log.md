Sessions
--------

Sessions are usually warm-up (collecting data for other projects, asking
for directions, compliments, directly asking men for their phone number)
and then main approaches, with notes on the quality of the interaction
and the result. At the end, I try to extract lessons and ideas for
improvement out of the session.

### 2019-12-07

My wing didn't show up, so I was out alone from 13:15 to 14:15 (it's
amazing how long the time feels while walking around not approaching).

Started off incredibly sluggish, I tried warming up by approaching guys
(which resulted in me getting a number from a chinese businessman –
you never know what is going to come over that approach).

Not many women alone, streets were either very crowded (approach
difficult/not feasible due to pressure on girl) or completely empty
(no girls at all). Either it's the location (city center) or the time
(saturday afternoon) – probably the latter.

Still, bad performance on my side. I hadn't approached in a while,
and it showed (mostly through approach anxiety).

I approached ~5-6 guys, asking for numbers as warmup. Then a long time
of nothing, then started just giving as many compliments as possible
(gave ~5 compliments). That helped reduce approach anxiety. 1 asian girl
that received a compliment might have been open. Another (also asian)
girl blew out the compliment.

#### Approaches

1.	French girl, went in directly. Didn't speak french with her,
	english instead. A mistake? Had a boyfriend.

#### Lessons

Just give compliments to anybody, as fast as possible. Then start doing
approaches.

Maybe saturdays are bad generally.

I felt good after the session.
