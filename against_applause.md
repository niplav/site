Against Applause After Classical Concerts
==========================================

> Silence is a hard virtue.

Arguing Against Applause
------------------------

In visual art, curators try to create a well-fitting environment for the
art: either a neutral environment in the case of modern or abstract art,
or a culturally fitting environment in a tasteful building and well-lit
rooms.

In this regard, it seems like visual art is curated mostly along
spatial categories: buildings, rooms, space, and lighting. So, if one
were to curate music, which categories would be important? Since music
is curated, this is not a hypothetical: music is curated mostly after
temporal categories such as time and order.

However, one ritual does not fit into this: clapping before, during and
after concerts puts noise directly before and after a performance. An
analogy with visual art would be putting tv screens with static next to
pieces of abstract art (and not as part of the art work!). This could
perhaps fit with some pieces of art, but would mostly be distracting
and counter-productive to understanding the piece. So, why does a society
put noise before, after, and sometimes even into music?

On the contrary, treating classical music like visual art would imply creating
a fitting soundscape around a piece of music. Concretely, this could
consist of a fixed period of silence before and after a piece of music,
or a fitting low complexity soundscape that prepares for the piece
about to be played. I am much more in favour of having silence, since
sorrounding music seems hard to pull of so that it fits.

There is some evidence that silence indeed __is__ appreciated by people
who listen to classical music in concert. For example, an acquaintance
of mine told me enthusiastically about a performance of a symphony by
Bruckner that ended in half a minute of silence before the applause
started, which he highly appreciated (despite being against eschewing
applause entirely). Furthermore, it is a great faux-pas to clap before
the last note of a piece has ended, especially when interrupting a
decrescendo at the end of a piece. A more crude observation can be made
about interrupting sounds during a concert like talking or coughing,
a cardinal sin for somebody in a concert hall, though this seems less
relevant because there is a diffence between distraction during music
and distraction before and after music.

Counterarguments
----------------

### Applause Does fit Because of Cultural History

### Applause is a Useful Appreciation Signal

### Correct Clapping as a Signal of Sophistication and Knowledge

Other Approaches
----------------

### Existing Different Approaches

* Silence
* [Jazz hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands)

### Possible new Forms of Appreciation

TODO: research this topic a lot more:

* Find out how culturally universal clapping/audible appreciation of performance is
* Find out what art theories claim about how to present art
* Find out about the evolutionary/cultural history of clapping, and make a summary (put on Wikipedia)
* Read the Wikipedia articles about applause/clapping, and perhaps improve them
* Similar criticisms?
* Differences of type and scope of applause in different forms of music.

Tangents:

The exact fitting moments of applause are a difficult topic in classical
music and the source of many faux-pas, abolishing applause would remove
these mistakes, but also prevent the ability to express class by knowing
where to clap (and the possibility to keep out ignorant philistines).
