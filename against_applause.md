Against Applause After Classical Concerts
==========================================

> Silence is a hard virtue.

Arguing Against Applause
------------------------

In visual art, curators try to create a well-fitting environment for the
art: either a neutral environment in the case of modern or abstract art,
or a culturally fitting environment in a tasteful building and well-lit
rooms.

In this regard, it seems like visual art is curated mostly along
spatial categories: buildings, rooms, space, and lighting. So, if one
were to curate music, which categories would be important? Since music
is curated, this is not a hypothetical: music is curated mostly after
temporal categories such as time and order.

However, one ritual does not fit into this: clapping before, during and
after concerts puts noise directly before and after a performance. An
analogy with visual art would be putting tv screens with static next to
pieces of abstract art (and not as part of the art work!). This could
perhaps fit with some pieces of art, but would mostly be distracting
and counter-productive to understanding the piece. So, why does a society
put noise before, after, and sometimes even between pieces music?

On the contrary, treating classical music like visual art would imply creating
a fitting soundscape around a piece of music. Concretely, this could
consist of a fixed period of silence before and after a piece of music,
or a fitting low complexity soundscape that prepares for the piece
about to be played. I am much more in favour of having silence, since
sorrounding music seems hard to pull of so that it fits.

There is some evidence that silence indeed __is__ appreciated by people
who listen to classical music in concert. For example, an acquaintance
of mine told me enthusiastically about a performance of a symphony by
Bruckner that ended in half a minute of silence before the applause
started, which he highly appreciated (despite being against eschewing
applause entirely). Furthermore, it is a great faux-pas to clap before
the last note of a piece has ended, especially when interrupting a
decrescendo at the end of a piece. A more crude observation can be made
about interrupting sounds during a concert like talking or coughing,
a cardinal sin for somebody in a concert hall, though this seems less
relevant because there is a diffence between distraction during music
and distraction before and after music.

### Preventing Incorrect Clapping

The exact fitting moments of applause are a difficult topic in classical
music and the source of many mistakes on the side of the audience,
abolishing applause would remove these mistakes, but also prevent the
ability to signal status and knowledge by knowing where to clap (and
the possibility to keep out ignorant philistines).

<!--TODO: check whether this is correct-->

Examples for such incorrect applause is clapping prematurely, applause
between different movements of the same piece (for different pieces,
this is fine though‽) and clapping after a particularly impressive solo
(which is okay in Jazz, but not in classical music).

All of this confusion could be avoided by eschewing applause entirely.

Counterarguments
----------------

### Applause Does Fit Because of Cultural History

Just like the tuning of the instruments before a classical concert,
applause can be considered an important part of the ritual that goes
along with all forms of art. If that were the case, removing such an
integral part would be not beneficial to the appreciation of the piece,
but detrimental. I personally feel that removing the tuning of instruments
at the beginning of a piece is not as urgent as removing applause,
although they both have a negative impact on the pure experiential aspect
of classical music (although, at least, tuning instruments is in the same
category of sound as the concert itself, with the sounds being produced
by instruments, and not just being white-noise-ish background sounds).

There is an interesting trade-off to be observed here: one between
following art-intrinsic rituals, and optimizing for an optimal
experience. Similarly, one could argue that painters do not matter,
and images should be sold on their individual quality alone. This,
of course, would violate the idea of brand-building in the artist
community, render social gatherings of artists and collectors useless,
and destroy the culture around the artists and their works. Removing
applause wouldn't be as drastic, but in a similar spirit: Exchanging a
socially and historically aware conception of music for a very puristic
and theoretical one.

Still, it feels like not being offered a choice whether one wants to
participate in the rituals of classical music seems unfair to purists.
One could imagine concerts targeted especially at people who want to
isolate listening experience from everyday noise, maybe even gaining
popularity after a while because of a status as especially knowledgeable
coinisseurs of classical music. And the status signalling treadmill turns
and turns.

### Applause is Useful for Appreciation

Of course, all if this argumentation ignores the main function of
applause: Showing appreciation for the musicians'<!--Genitive for
plurals?--> performance in a clear way. Prohibiting applause entirely
would make it difficult for musicians to assess the quality of their
performance by observing different intensities of applause, though it
seems unclear how often musicians really optimize for loud, long and
frentic applause (and how often this kind of applause happens because
of the quality of the performance compared to the celebrity status of
some performers). It would also remove a major motivation for playing,
namely, receiving appreciation for a performance.

On the other hand, applause is not the only possible
appreciation signal available. One could imagine others that
would both leave the musicians satisfied, for example [Jazz
Hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands) or the amount of time
spent in the concert hall after the last note has been played.

### Correct Clapping as a Signal of Sophistication and Knowledge

Other Approaches

### Existing Different Approaches

#### Silence

#### [Jazz hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands)

### Possible new Forms of Appreciation

#### Staying in the Concert Hall
