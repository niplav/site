Against Applause after Classical Concerts
==========================================

> Silence is a hard virtue.

*– [Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/), [“The Virtue of Silence”]((https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/)), 2013*

TODO: research this topic a lot more:

* Find out how culturally universal clapping/audible appreciation of performance is
* Find out what art theories claim about how to present art
* Find out about the evolutionary/cultural history of clapping, and make a summary (put on wikipedia)
* Read the wikipedia articles about applause/clapping, and perhaps improve them
* Similar criticisms?
* Differences of type and scope of applause in different forms of music.

Tangents:

The exact fitting moments of applause are a difficult topic in classical
music and the source of many faux-pas, abolishing applause would remove
these mistakes, but also prevent the ability to express class by knowing
where to clap (and the possibility to keep out ignorant philistines).
