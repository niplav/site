Rationalist Gods
================

### Spelling

Spelling for these is not clear in all cases: sometimes Azathoth is
spelled "Asatoth", or Gnon is capitalized as "GNON". I have tried to
use the original spelling or the most widely used spelling.

Azathoth
--------

> The Price equation shows that a change in the average amount `$z$` of a trait in a population from one generation to the next (`$Δz$`) is determined by the [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covariance) between the amounts `$z_i$` of the trait for the subpopulation `$i$` and the fitnesses `$w_i$` of the subpopulations, together with the expected change in the amount of the trait value due to fitness, namely `$E(w_i Δz_i)$`:

> <div>
>	$$Δz=\frac{1}{w}\text{cov}(w_i, z_i)+\frac{1}{w} E(w_i, Δz_i)$$
> </div>

Gnon
----

> Gnon is no less than reality, whatever else is believed. Whatever is suspended now, without delay, is Gnon.

Cthulhu
-------

> Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left.

*— [Mencius Moldbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin), [“A Gentle Introduction to Unqualified Reservations Chapter 1: The Red Pill”](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified/), 2009*

> Cthulhu— god of memetics. Ideas winning out not because they are true or good but because they are virulent and persuasive.

The Goddess of Everything Else

Nggwal
-------

> Nggwal instead is a truly impressively example of
coordination—he is metaphorically and literally a collective
that unites even enemy communities in displays of dominance and
power. Nggwal as an entity symbolizes something of significant
interest to me and a key focus of this blog: namely all the
ways in which men cooperate to do extreme and destructive things
to themselves and others.
