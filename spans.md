Have Attention Spans Been Declining?
=====================================

The question is not

* "Does more social media/internet usage cause decreased attention spans?"
* "Does more social media/internet usage correlate with decreased attention spans?"
* "Does more social media/internet usage correlate with people reporting having shorter attention spans?"

How Is Attention Span Defined?
-------------------------------

[Attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention) is generally
divided into three distinct categories: **sustained attention**, which
is the consistent focus on a specific task or piece of information
over time (Wikipedia states that the span for sustained attention
has a [leprechaun](https://www.gwern.net/Leprechauns) figure of
10 minutes floating around); **selective attention**, which is
the ability to resist distractions while focusing on important
information while performing on a task (the thing trained during
[mindfulness meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness)); and
**alternating** or **divided attention**, also known as the ability to
[multitask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking).

How Do We Measure Attention Span?
----------------------------------

What Would the Ideal Study Look Like?
--------------------------------------

What Are the Existing Investigations?
-------------------------------------

* [Gausby 2015](./doc/psychology/attention_span/attention_spans_gausby_et_al_2015.pdf)
	* Methods for assessing attention span:
		* Three online tests (probably devised by the authors (?), since no source is given) (n≈2000 Canadians). Very little information about the exact nature of the tests.
			* Sustained attention span: "Counting the number of times responds correctly identified an X occurring after an A."
			* Selective attention span: "Counting the number of times respondents correctly identified a change in the orientation of the rectangles"
			* Alternating attention span: "Calculating the difference in the time lapsed to perform a series of consecutive number or letter classification, compared to a mixture of number and letter classifications."
		* Neurological research: The same games/tests as above with the participants being measured with an EEG ("Results were reported as ACE (Attention, Connectivity, Encoding) scores, as well as the number of attention bursts") (n=112 Canadians)
	* Questions answered:
		* Sustained attention:
			* *Do younger people perform worse on the sustained attention span test?*, Yes (31% high sustained attention for group aged 18-34, 34% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+) (the methodology is wholly unclear here, though: how do we determine the group that has "high sustained attention span"? Did they perform any statisitical tests? If yes, which?).
			* *Do people who report more technology usage (web browsing/multi-screen usage while online/social media usage/tech adoption) perform worse on the sustained attention span test?*, Yes. Light:medium:heavy usage for web browsing has 39%:33%:27% users with high sustained attention span, 36%:33%:27% for light:medium:heavy multi-screen usage, 36%:29%:23% for light:medium:heavy social media usage and 35%:31%:25% for light:medium:heavy tech adoption (though these numbers are basically not elaborated on).
		Selective attention:
			* *Do younger people perform worse on the selective attention span test?* No (34% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 30% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+).
			* *Do people with high selective attention use fewer devices at the same time?* Yes (details p. 31).
		* Alternating attention:
			* *Do younger people perform worse on the alternating attention span test?* No (36% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 28% for group aged 35-54, and 36% group aged 55+).
			* *Do people who report more technology usage (tech adoption/web browsing/multi-screen usage while online) perform worse on the alternating attention span test?* No, they seem to perform better: Light:medium:heavy tech adoption corresponds to 31%:39%:40% having high alternating attention spans, light:medium:heavy web browsing to 29%:34%:37% and multi-screening while online to 27%:32%:37%.
			* *Do people who use social media more have higher Attention/Connection/Encoding scores on EEG measurements?*, Not quite: "Moderate users of social media are better at multi-tasking than lower users. But, when crossing into the top quartile of social media usage, scores plummet."
	* This is a marketing statement wearing the skinsuit of a previously great paper, it would be awesome if they released their exact methodology (tests performed, data collected, exact calculations & code written). I can smell that they actually put effort into the research: Creating an actual test instead of just asking respondents about their attention spans, doing EEG measurements of over 100 people, for 3 different types of attention…come on! Just put out there what you did!
* [Carstens et al. 2018](./doc/psychology/attention_span/social_media_impact_on_atention_span_carstens_et_al_2018.pdf) (n=209 American respondents to a survey)
	* Questions answered:
		* Is self-reported attention span related to the number of social media accounts?, No, not statistically significant (F(2, 206)=0.1223, p>0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)
		* Is self-reported attention span related to whether a respondent mainly uses a mobile phone or a computer?, No, not statistically significant (P(2,713)=0.923, p>0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)
	* Method for assesing attention span: Questionnaire developed by the authors based on Conners 2004 (reliability: α=0.786)
	* I do **not** trust this paper: Calling (what I think is) Generation Z "Generation D" (without source for the term), being clearly written in Word, and bad grammar (I *think* the authors are all Americans, so no excuse here):

> Users that are older such as late adolescents and emerging adults
average approximately 30-minutes daily for just Facebook that does not
calculate the time spent on all social media networks

> Bakardjieva and Gaden (2012) examined the field of social interaction
in general to the everyday chatter of unstructured and spontaneous
interactions among individuals to highly structured and regulated
interaction consisting of the military or the stock exchange.

Why Are They So Inadequate?
----------------------------

------

When asking the question "have attention spans been declining",
we'd ideally want the same test measung all those three aspects of
attention (and not just asking people about their [perception via
surveys](https://guzey.com/statistics/dont-believe-self-reported-data/)),
performed anually on large random samples of humans over decades,
ideally with additional information such as age, sex, intelligence (or
alternatively educational attainment), occupation etc. I'm personally
most interested in the development of sustained attention, and less so
in the development of selective attention. But I have not been able to
find such research, and in fact there is apparently no agreed upon test
for measuring attention span in the first place:

> She studies attention in drivers and witnesses to crime and says the
idea of an "average attention span" is pretty meaningless. "It's very
much task-dependent. How much attention we apply to a task will vary
depending on what the task demand is."

*— Simon Maybin quoting Dr. Gemma Briggs, [“Busting the attention span myth”](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790), 2017*

(So, [similar to
comas](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/11/does-the-glasgow-coma-scale-exist-do-comas/),
attention span doesn't exist…)

When asking whether attention spans have been declining, we'd
ideally want to have experiments from up to 2019: close enough
to the present to see whether there is a downward trend (a bit
more than a decade after the introduction of the [iPhone in
2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPhone_\(1st_generation\))),
but before the [COVID-19
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) which might
be a huge confounder, or just have accelerated existing trends (which
we can probably check in another 2 years).

A commonly cited resource on the decline of attention span is Gausby et
al. 2015 from Microsoft research. I'm not a huge fan of the study: It's
already seven years old, which in internet years means we should prepare
for its cryopreservation; its glossy makeup, corporate sponsoring and
being directed at marketing professionals doesn't quite inspire confidence
in me, and it is not very precise (often speaking of "% high sustained
attention by demographic", without specifying what "high" is supposed
to mean here). Add to that that they cite a probably [fallacious figure
of a 8-second](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790) attention span
([Twyman's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyman's_law) in action).

Having said all that, Gausby et al. 2015 states self-described
heavy social-media users and early tech adopters do significantly
worse in terms of sustained attention than lighter social-media
users (though they don't make clear whether they controlled
for age, which [increases with age until the early
40's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span#Human_Attention_Span_Over_Time)).

Appendix A: Claims That Attention Spans Have Been Declining
------------------------------------------------------------

Most of these are either unsourced or cites [Gausby
2015](./doc/psychology/attention_span/attention_spans_gausby_et_al_2015.pdf "Attention spans")
[fallaciously](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790).

> Today, individuals are constantly on an information overload from
both the quantity of information available and the speed of which
information gets into the hands of individuals through advertising and
multimedia. Attention deficits tend to be increasing as it is challenging
to attract individuals and hold their attention long enough for people
to read or watch messages such as work memos, advertisements, etc.
