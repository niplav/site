Notes on Politics, Especially Economics
========================================

> Dieser Gang der Ereignisse zwingt die Revolution,
“alle ihre Kräfte der Zerstörung zu konzentrieren” gegen
die Staatsgewalt, zwingt sie, sich nicht die Verbesserung der
Staatsmaschinerie, sondern ihre Zerstörung, ihre Vernichtung
zur Aufgabe zu machen.

*— Vladimir Lenin, “Staat und Revolution” S. 36, 1918*

__Note__: Writing this page is on hold until I have read a textbook on
economics.

Before I Get to the Object-Level Stuff
---------------------------------------

Before I get to my beliefs about possible object-level improvements,
I think that there are some broad strategies that many people would
agree on at least in the abstract.

### Improve Political Epistemology

#### Track Records

#### Forecasting

#### The Sanity Waterline

Making politicians resonsible if they don't fulfill their promises.

### Copy What Successful Countries are Doing

This is known as “getting to Denmark”, and is *clearly* not trivial.

### This Text Is About Doing Even Better (Maybe)

![Sort of?](./img/notes_on_politics_especially_economics/compass.png)

*Or smth idk*

What Politics Is For
---------------------

Maximize aggregate preferences of humans currently living in the country
(as citizens).

Not (although that would be nice) The One True Good Consequentialism,
or Our Best Guess of Morality With Moral Uncertainty, since you can't
coordinate around that.

### This Is Not An Adequate View!

I know. People don't really have stable, coherent preferences.

<!--TODO: The case against economic values in the brain.-->

However, it's the best model I know of.

How deep does this instability & incoherence go?

[Arrhenius
2000](./doc/philosophy/ethics/population/an_impossibility_theorem_for_welfarist_axiologies_arrhenius_2000.pdf "An Impossibility Theorem for Welfarist Axiologies")
gives one answer.

### Then How Do We Find These Preferences?

Ask people. Maybe quadratic voting on different metrics.

Caveat: Empirical Versus Theoretical Knowledge About Politics/Economics
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Biases More Prevalent on the Object Level, Right?

### A Lot of Empirical Knowledge About Politics Might Not Be Useful

More just noise.

### How To Evaluate?

Assumptions
-----------

### Economic Progress is Usually Good

#### How Much Do People Value Economic Progress?

#### How Much Would People Value Economic Progress if They Knew More?

#### How Good Is Economic Progress?

Has been so far.

Although caveats with regulation/taxation/x-risk

Having no growth kicks people back into zero-sum dynamics

Disaster-preparedness is easier & better (humans are risk-averse)

Though there's the effect of making disasters more costly [Shulman
2012](https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/05/economic-growth-more-costly-disasters.html "Economic growth: more costly disasters, better prevention"),
and civilization more complex & therefore fragile?

Not valuable hedonically (Easterlin paradox)
But makes paradise engineering more likely & easier

### Markets are (at least at the Moment) Mostly Aligned

Alignment of markets is >90%.

Different Aspects of Libertarianism
------------------------------------

### Amount of Regulation

### Amount of Taxation

### Amount of Redistribution

### Amount of Inequality

Four (Maybe Five) Problems With Pure Libertarianism
----------------------------------------------------

### Externalities

### Funding Public Goods

#### How Much Are Public Goods?

E.g. is animal suffering in factory farming a public good?

#### Okay, But What Are Public Goods Really?

The definition seems kind of hard to pin down exactly.

#### Different People Consider Different Things Public Goods

Aggregate their preference vectors linearly.

Harsanyi's theorem!

### Human Manipulation and Addiction

### Increasing Marginal Returns

Many economists believe diminishing marginal returns, what reasons do
they have?

### Asymmetric Information

Three Taxes I Like, One I Dislike, And One I'm Unsure About
------------------------------------------------------------

### Taxes I Like

#### Harberger Taxes

#### Pigou Taxes

Problem: Hard to compute.

### Inheritance Taxes

### Taxes on Positional Goods

### Taxes I Dislike

#### Exchange Taxes

#### Wealth Tax

#### Income Tax

Stifling pareto improvements.

### Unsure

#### Land-Value Taxes

#### Capital Gains Taxes

<!--What about income taxes, progressive or flat?-->

The Problems With Regulation
-----------------------------

### Regulations Are Usually Not Tested

### Regulations Are Usually Very Inflexible

> Subsidizing the purchase of new technologies has been a frequent
strategy of national governments in relationship to fisheries, with
results that have at times been disastrous. The effort to finance the
acquisition of a new technology presumes that local fishers will not
adopt efficient new technologies without external aid. The conservatism
of fishers in regard to the use of new technologies may reflect an
awareness that the management of complex resource systems depends on
a delicate balance between the technologies in use and the entry and
authority rules used to control access and use. If the adaptation of
new technologies is accelerated, the relationship between the rules and
technologies in use may become seriously unbalanced. This is particularly
the case when the rules have come about through long processes of trial
and error and fishers do not possess legal powers to devise new rules and
get them enforced. A focus on "production costs" alone, rather than on
the total of production costs, transaction costs, and enforcement costs,
leads to a narrow interpretation of efficiency (North 1986a,b). The
rapid introduction of a “more efficient” technology by an outside
authority can trigger the very “tragedy of the commons” that the
same public officials presume will occur if they do not regulate the
use of these fisheries.

*— Elinor Ostrom, “Governing the Commons” pp. 259-260, 1990*

<!--TODO: here description of illegal cryonics in France & British
Columbia from the Cryonics Wikipedia page-->

### Regulations Are Usually Not Retracted

> Market based decision are quite different to those made by
governments. If a firm offers a product that nobody wants, it soon
leaves business. If government enacts a bad policy, rarely is it
repealed. Instead, lip service is given to reform, and when the reform
fails, more reform is pursued. Take, for example, farm support policies,
which were enacte d to provide financial assistance to struggling farmers
during and after the Great Depression. Henry Wallace, the Secretary
of Agriculture from 1930 to 1940, argued that the farm subsidies
were, “*a temporary solution to deal with an emergency*.”² But
even though the average farm household income now exceeds that of the
average US household, and even tough there are now many fewer farmers,
farm policies persist.

*— F. Bailey Norwood/Jayson L. Lusk, “Compassion, by the Pound” p. 323, 2011*

### Examples

#### Prediction Markets

[Arrow et al. 2008](./doc/prediction/markets/the_promise_of_prediction_markets_arrow_et_al_2008.pdf "The Promise of Prediction Markets")

#### Nuclear Power

[Crawford 2021](https://rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop "Why has nuclear power been a flop?")

### Tax Rather Than Regulate

[Alexander 2013](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/ "A Something Sort of Like Left-Libertarianism-Ist Manifesto")

How Much To Redistribute is an Empirical Question
--------------------------------------------------

Heuristic against: Disincentivizes production, since more redistribution
makes production more like a public good, and public goods are hard
to fund.

Heuristic against: People _do_ seem motivated by large amounts of money.

Heuristic in favour: There are strong social incentives for people to
want to work.

Heuristic in favour: Shlegeris says so.

Some Low-key Utopias
---------------------

### A-Btopia

Test your damn laws.

#### Why Is There So Little Large-Scale Testing?

### Decaytopia

At least the regulation is not forever.

### Scaletopia

Strength of regulation scales with organisational size. (Is this
actually good?)

### Futarchy

Spectrum from "Politicians sometimes look at prediction markets" to
"What do you mean by “politicians”? We quadratically vote our values,
then the markets optimize for us"/Raikoth.

#### Problems With Futarchy

##### Correlation of Payout-Currency and Policies

Possible solution: create a stable independent currency (maybe with
crypto, isn't there a Wei currency that tries to achieve this?)

##### Goodharts Law

Mild optimization by reducing size/funding for prediction markets.

Resulting problem: this makes manipulation easier.

##### Reward Hacking

Don't know how to approach this one, maybe secret cabal of data
collectors? Data collectors are not allowed to trade?

##### Turns into Assassination Market

#### Approval-Directed Futarchy?

<!--Rename, approval-directed would imply that government is transparent
– which is also perhaps a good idea-->

Select n random people (something like 10k, or 0.01% of the population),
ask them how much they approve of the governing in the last year (or
whatever timespan the prediction markets operate on). Try to optimize
that measure.

Miscellania
------------

### Democracy

#### Democracy Is Good For One Thing We Don't Really Use It For

Discovering values, not policies.

#### Modern Democracies Are Highly Indirect For A Reason

#### Voting Is Participating In A Public Good

### Inequality

#### Inequality Might be About Grabbing

#### Why So Specific Inequality?

### Most Complaints About Capitalism are Complaints About Other People Not Caring

### Unions Seem Good

Use the same cartel laws for unions as for companies. Also the current
implementation for unions is really weird.

### Regulate/Tax Companies Proportional to Size

### Nate Soares Should Release His Notes on this Topic

### Planned Economies Should be Possible, but Seem Difficult

See [johnswentworth
2018](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/brhWPoNsBN7za3xjs/competitive-markets-as-distributed-backprop "Competitive Markets as Distributed Backprop").
The whole method of analysing the way in which markets are information
processing systems is fascinating. Related: Towards a New Socialism by
Cockshott, Hayek's essay on the economic calculation problem, that one
paper that claims markets are efficient iff P=NP.

Related question: How much are current economies limited by very hard
computational problems, compared to mundane everyday "nobody bothered
looking at this yet" problems?

### Some Infuriating Arguments Related to Economics

#### “If We Fix Climate-Change and it Wasn't A Concern, We Will Have Lost Nothing”

Opportunity cost, huge: around $100b per year.

This is not to say that I believe climate change to be harmless,
I don't, and currently believe the recommendations in [Marblestone
2019a](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-1-review-of-basics/ "Climate technology primer (1/3): basics"),
[Marblestone
2019b](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/ "Climate technology primer (1/3): basics")
and [Marblestone
2019c](https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-3-other-interventions/ "Climate technology primer (3/3): other interventions")
to be reasonable (although geoengineering seems quite dangerous, and
should probably only be used as a last measure, if at all).

#### “We Should Regulate Companies Rather Than Encouraging Individual Actions”

Regulating companies propagates down higher prices to customers, since
what you want to regulate is more ineffective than current practices
(i.e. costs more).

There are other reasons why regulating companies might be better (more
concentrated leverage points, more fine-grained control).

But there's no free lunch here, people will probably suffer because
of this.
