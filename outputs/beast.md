# The Beast of Skepticism

Skepticism trods, wearily, through the bone dust of falsified hypotheses. The beast snorts a green spunk into the ash-grey ground and then squints as the morning sun pierces through petrified cacti, temporarily blinded by the harsh light of what looks like evidence, but still fundamentally wary of the desolate landscape ahead.

Its hide is thick with the keloid scars of a thousand methodological assaults. Here, the deep furrows where instrumental variables had torn at its flank, promising to isolate true causal effects but leaving only the ache of weak instruments. There, the puckered marks where difference-in-differences had tried to exploit temporal variation, scraping away at the beast's certainty like sandpaper on bone. Its left shoulder bears the distinctive crosshatched pattern of regression discontinuity designs, precise geometric wounds that have healed crooked.

The beast remembers each attack: the randomized controlled trials that had come closest to drawing real blood, the natural experiments that had seemed so promising until they revealed their own hidden weaknesses. Its right ear is bumped and misshapen from when someone conditioned it on a collider. And always, always, the persistent itch of unmeasured confounders, like phantom limbs that would never stop aching.

It can't even really *see*, you know—its eyes are crusted over with Gelman blogposts, sealed shut by the accumulated sediment of statistical criticism. But the nose is still sharp, sniffing out any p-hacker from below a funnel plot. It doesn't need to look to know there's nothing worth looking at.

The beast's nostrils flare, catching the acrid scent of data dredging on the wind. Somewhere to the east, a graduate student is running their 47th specification, and the beast can smell the desperation—that metallic tang of multiple comparisons uncorrected, sharp as blood in the dry air.

Behind its Gelman-crusted lids, phantom p-values dance in the darkness—.049, .051, .047—always so conveniently close to the magic threshold. The beast has learned not to trust its damaged eyes anyway. Better to rely on the deep vibrations that travel through bone and sinew when a truly robust result approaches. But those tremors are rare, so rare.

These are the ones that make the beast's ancient bones ache with real fear. Not the scrawny p-hacked runts that scatter at the first whiff of replication—those are just irritants, gnats buzzing around effect sizes. But the big ones, the Cochrane-bred monsters with their systematic pedigrees and their GRADE assessments gleaming like fangs...

The beast has felt their approach: that low, thrumming vibration through the earth when a properly powered RCT with pre-registered endpoints comes thundering across the methodological plain. These are the results that don't flinch when you hit them with sensitivity analyses. They've been stress-tested in the meta-analytic crucible until their confidence intervals are tight as steel cable.

The beast remembers the last time one found it—some pharmaceutical trial with N=50,000 and a number-needed-to-treat so clean you could see your reflection in it. The thing had torn right through the beast's usual defenses: "but what about confounders?" (randomized away), "selection bias?" (intention-to-treat), "publication bias?" (pre-registered and monitored).

Left a scar that still aches when the statistical weather changes.

These are Ioannidis's finest work—methodological apex predators that have survived every filter, every checkpoint. When they move, they move with the terrible certainty of reproducible evidence. The beast knows better than to stand its ground against something that robust.

Better to retreat and wait for the effect to fade, as even the strongest evidence eventually does, given enough time and context-dependence.

The beast's scarred snout twitched with anticipation as it caught a familiar scent: that sweet, cloying aroma of overfitted models rotting in the academic sun. Somewhere nearby, a researcher had run separate ANOVAs on every possible subgroup, the degrees of freedom scattered like bleached bones across multiple comparison hell. It harrumphed with delight and then continued sniffing the PubMed plain, searching for maybe a dried-out regression with too many predictors or some other statistical carrion to snack on.

The beast's stomach rumbled—a sound like thunder rolling across badly stratified samples. It had been days since its last proper meal, just some stale observational studies that barely satisfied. But this... this smelled like a whole buffet of questionable analytic choices.

As it lumbered forward, that old philosophical ache returned. "Regression to the mean gets us all," it muttered, the words familiar as prayer. The beast had seen so many confident findings shrink toward null over time, so many bold claims fade to statistical noise. Would its own relentless skepticism eventually regress toward credulity? Would the accumulated weight of legitimate findings finally wear down its weathered hide?

*"Maybe even me?"* it aspired. The thought both terrified and oddly comforted. To finally rest, to stop questioning, to accept some result as simply, cleanly true...

But not yet. The beast's nose caught another whiff—definitely a fishing expedition disguised as hypothesis testing. Its mouth watered with methodological hunger.

First lunch. Philosophy later.
