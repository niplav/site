# Worldbuilding Document: The Memetic Hazard World

## Core Concepts

This world is similar to our own but information-based hazards have immediate, measurable, and sometimes catastrophic effects on human cognition. Memes are not mere cultural ideas but cognitive entities that can spread, evolve, interact, and fundamentally alter how people think and behave. Some memes are beneficial, some are neutral, and some are existentially dangerous.

The question of whether memes are conscious or have preferences is deliberately ambiguous. They sometimes respond to their hosts, blur boundaries with host personalities, and exhibit behavior that suggests agency. Whether this represents genuine consciousness or merely complex pattern dynamics remains philosophically unresolved. In practical terms, this ambiguity does not matter for safety protocols or legal frameworks.

The world could be interpreted in two ways. The subtle reading suggests this is our world but psychological and memetic phenomena receive serious infrastructure and attention. Group dynamics, intrusive thoughts, advertising, and social contagion are treated with appropriate gravity. The extreme reading suggests memetic transmission and effects are genuinely more intense than in our reality, with different underlying mechanisms for information processing and neuroplasticity. The ambiguity between these interpretations is intentional.

## Scale and Types of Memetic Entities

**Micro-scale (milliseconds to seconds):** Crackers, darts, parrots, crickets. These are brief intense exposures designed for specific immediate effects. A cracker provides a positive experiential state. A dart is a personalized cognitive hazard targeting one individual. A parrot is a visual image causing severe effects including death. A cricket is an acoustic equivalent of a parrot.

**Small-scale (days to weeks):** Simple personae, blockers, negatives. A persona is a semi-autonomous cognitive pattern that can be shared across multiple individuals. A blocker prevents the carrier from performing specific actions. A negative is a self-destructive or other-destructive meme that tries to eliminate itself, similar memes, or all memes.

**Medium-scale (months):** Complex personae like Harmonizer, ideological frameworks, sustained behavioral patterns. These require ongoing maintenance and can establish stable presence in a community or individual.

**Large-scale (years):** Egregores with internal structure and psychofauna. Psychofauna are sub-memes that live within larger memetic entities, creating an ecosystem of parasitic, symbiotic, and predatory relationships between idea-components. Memetic ecologists study these relationships.

**Massive-scale (decades to centuries):** Religions, civilizational values, the deep memetic landscape. These are vast egregores that form the background cognitive environment for entire populations. Humans are simultaneously the substrate for these entities and partially aware of being such.

## Transmission Vectors and Potency

**Most potent - Direct interpersonal transmission:** Requires physical presence, eye contact, and shared space. The meme lives in the carrier who can transmit it through their presence. High-end crackers and personae use this vector. The carrier embodies the meme and it bleeds naturally into nearby people through sustained contact. Cannot be recorded or replicated without a human intermediary.

**Potent - Acoustic transmission:** Voice, music, sound. Can be recorded but the recording is degraded compared to direct transmission. Songs can be crickets. Certain acoustic patterns are banned or require screening before public release. Music requires pre-release cricket screening.

**Moderate - Audiovisual transmission:** Video, combined media formats. Further degraded from direct transmission but scalable. Most commercial crackers use this vector as a compromise between potency and market reach.

**Weak - Visual and textual transmission:** Images, text, written content. Weakest transmission vector but most easily shared. Parrots operate through this vector despite causing severe effects, which makes them particularly dangerous since they spread easily.

## Terminology and Slang

**Panmemic:** A pandemic-scale memetic outbreak. Historical example might be "The 2037 Cyan Panmemic killed 40,000 through coordinated suicide clusters."

**Cogsec:** Cognitive security protocols and practices. Includes not clicking suspicious links, practicing memetic hygiene, regular Implicit Association Testing, and maintaining clean information environments. Corporate cogsec officers and personal cogsec consultants exist as professions.

**Negatives:** Self-destructive or other-destructive memes. Response teams specialize in negative containment. Slang usage: "Jin caught a negative, had to be sedated."

**Parrots:** Visual cognitive hazards that cause severe harm or death through observation. Illegal to possess, distribute, or create. Parrot-makers are treated as terrorists. Some may be natural phenomena - certain mathematical patterns or visual fractals that humans are vulnerable to.

**Crickets:** Acoustic cognitive hazards equivalent to parrots. Certain songs are banned. Music requires pre-release cricket screening before commercial distribution.

**Crackers:** Audiovisual or interpersonal memes that are beautiful, positive, and beneficial. Huge commercial industry exists for cracker production and distribution. Categories include morning crackers (energizing), evening crackers (calming), and social crackers (enhance bonding without persona formation). Premium streaming services include therapeutic crackers. Cracker cafes offer curated experiential collections. Dating apps list cracker preferences.

**Blockers:** Memes preventing carriers from performing specific actions. Legal and ethical debates surround their use. Therapeutic applications include gambling blockers and addiction blockers. Coercive applications include testimony blockers and relationship-trapping blockers. Schedule I through IV classifications exist similar to controlled substances. Black market blocker removal services exist.

**Drag:** The subjective internal feeling of memetic load. Often used interchangeably with memetic load in popular culture though technically drag is phenomenological while load is objective measurement. Casual usage: "I'm feeling so much drag today" could mean memetic burden or just tiredness.

**Spooks:** Extremely competent government or WMO agents tasked with finding and containing the most dangerous memes, including civilization-ending hazards. Keep extremely low profiles because being profiled makes them vulnerable to targeted attacks. May be partly legendary though confirmed to exist.

**Kanto (verb):** To profile someone thoroughly enough to create targeted memes against them. Etymology from Death Note's Kanto region broadcast used to narrow down Kira's location. Usage: "They kantoed me from my LinkedIn" means someone scraped enough information to build a targeting profile. Anti-kanto practices include pseudonymity, compartmentalization, and regular identity churn. High-threat individuals like executives, politicians, and spooks employ kanto-protection services.

**Darts:** Personalized cognitive hazards targeting a specific individual. Requires extensive intelligence gathering about the target's psychology, traumas, fears, and vulnerabilities. One perfectly calibrated image or phrase can cause instant breakdown or death. Dart artists work as memetic assassins. Making darts for spooks is especially difficult because spooks have been extensively profiled for security clearance.

**Psychofauna:** Sub-memes living within larger memetic entities. Create ecosystems with parasitic, symbiotic, and predatory relationships. Memetic ecologists study and map these internal populations. Example: "The Christian egregore has been hosting a new psychofaunal bloom in Southeast Asia."

**Bloom:** A beneficial meme going viral, contrasted with "outbreak" for harmful memes spreading rapidly.

**Carrier:** Person who transmits a meme, sometimes asymptomatically. High-value cracker carriers are trained professionals who perform live transmissions. For direct interpersonal crackers, the carrier is the only way to experience the full potency.

**Hot zone:** Area with active severe memetic contamination requiring quarantine and specialized response.

**Cryptomeme:** Hidden or sleeper meme that may activate under specific conditions. Related to antimemes which actively resist being known or remembered.

**Antimeme:** Information that resists being known, remembered, or propagated. Antimemetic hazards are particularly dangerous because they prevent awareness of their own existence. Specialized containment requires protocols that work even when personnel forget why they're implementing them.

**Memetic load:** Objective measurement of how much memetic material a person is carrying. Distinguished from drag which is the subjective experience.

**Clean room:** Sensory deprivation environment combined with meditation protocols used for memetic decontamination. Response teams use these for recovery after exposure.

**Burnout:** When a response team member's cognitive immune system fails from accumulated exposure. Career-ending condition for most responders.

**Soul-forging:** Extremely rare event when two dart artists' perfectly mirrored darts collide, creating bidirectional total mutual understanding rather than destruction. Only documented handful of times. Creates permanent bond between individuals.

**Grabby:** Descriptor for personae that begin establishing dominance over individual autonomy, optimizing for their own propagation at the expense of host wellbeing.

**Mutualist:** Beneficial or symbiotic relationship between meme and host. Mutualist personae can enhance capabilities without dominating the individual.

## Infrastructure and Institutions

**World Memetic Organization (WMO):** International body coordinating memetic health policy and emergency response. Hosts emergency sessions for pandemic-level threats. Votes determine whether memes receive pandemic classification (mandatory global inoculation) or lower-level monitoring. Different member nations have different interests based on their domestic memetic cultivation scenes and economic considerations.

**Border Controls:** Airports and checkpoints include EEG or fMRI screening, intensive psychological interviews, and trained border psychologists looking for contamination indicators. Signs read "Declare all personae" alongside agricultural product declarations. Anomalous synchronization patterns, characteristic persona binding in default mode networks, and overly consistent or robotic interview responses flag travelers for detention.

**Insurance Industry:** Policies cover memetic damage. Panmemic-related cognitive damage requires specific coverage. Insurance fraud involving faked memetic exposure is prosecuted.

**Cracker Industry:** Major commercial sector including composition studios, carrier training programs, distribution platforms, and regulatory approval processes. Memetic intellectual property theft is serious white-collar crime. Composers often work in isolation to prevent signature leakage. Watermarking techniques and forensic analysis can trace crackers back to their composers. High-end crackers require live performance by trained carriers and cannot be recorded effectively.

**Response Teams:** Specialized units handling memetic incidents. Require decade-long training pipelines including intensive meditation, self-reflection, and inoculation programs. Personnel are rare, expensive, and experience high burnout rates. Veterans develop cognitive scar tissue from repeated exposures. Recruitment draws from populations with unusual baseline psychology or natural resistance to certain memetic classes.

**Clean Rooms and Containment Facilities:** Medical infrastructure for memetic decontamination and recovery. Use sensory deprivation, meditation guidance, and therapeutic counter-memes. Quarantine protocols similar to infectious disease procedures but adapted for information hazards.

**Memetic Hazmat Teams:** Specialized responders for acute incidents. Different from response teams in that they handle immediate containment rather than long-term management. Equipped with portable clean rooms, counter-meme delivery systems, and contamination detection equipment.

## Economic and Legal Aspects

**Memetic Pharmaceutical Industry:** Develops therapeutic memes, vaccines against harmful memes, and inoculation protocols. Major contracts exist for pandemic-level responses. Companies compete for government contracts and market dominance. Research divisions work on understanding memetic mechanisms and creating targeted interventions.

**Intellectual Property:** Cracker compositions are valuable IP. Corporate espionage targeting composer signatures is common. Because crackers cannot be fully replicated from recordings or descriptions, theft requires direct proximity to the composer and time for their signature to bleed over. This creates unusual security requirements around high-value composers. Forensic memetic analysts can detect signature contamination and trace unauthorized copies.

**Black Market:** Stolen cracker templates, blocker removal services, dart commissions, banned parrots and crickets, contaminated artifacts from archaeological sites, illegal personae cultivation kits, antimemetic research data. Organized crime operates around memetic extraction and trafficking. Some black market operators specialize in kanto-protection breaches or creating untraceable darts.

**Legal Classifications:** 
- Level 1: Immediate containment and elimination required. No civilian contact permitted.
- Level 2: Monitoring without active suppression. May have beneficial uses.
- Level 3: General availability with tracking and usage restrictions.
- Level 4: Unrestricted but documented.

Schedule I-IV classifications exist for blockers and other controlled memetic substances, similar to drug scheduling.

**Professional Licensing:** Dart artists, cracker composers, memetic therapists, response team members, and carriers require certification. Illegal practice is prosecuted though black market operators exist. Training requirements vary by specialization but generally include cognitive resilience testing, ethics certification, and demonstrated technical competence.

**Criminal Law:** Parrot creation and distribution is treated as terrorism. Unauthorized dart use is assassination. Illegal persona cultivation carries significant penalties. Memetic intellectual property theft is corporate espionage. Kanto violations can be prosecuted under privacy laws depending on jurisdiction.

## Social and Cultural Elements

**Dating and Relationships:** Apps list cracker preferences, memetic load tolerance, persona compatibility. Relationships are complicated when one partner can experience certain memes and the other cannot. Couples discuss memetic hygiene and exposure risk. Some people seek partners with complementary memetic profiles - one person's resistance balances the other's vulnerability.

**Education:** Children learn memetic hygiene and basic cogsec from early ages. Memetic safety drills similar to fire drills. Universities offer advanced study in memetic ecology, memetic engineering, and containment protocols. Undergraduate programs typically include at least one memetics course as general education requirement.

**Media and Entertainment:** Pre-release screening for cricket properties before music distribution. Content ratings include memetic hazard warnings. Some artists are cracker snobs criticizing mass-market compositions. Cracker cafes and lounges offer curated experiential entertainment. Live carrier performances are prestigious and expensive. Music venues require memetic safety compliance.

**Public Health Campaigns:** Memetic hygiene PSAs. "Remember to fact-check your intrusive thoughts." Public awareness about contamination symptoms and when to seek treatment. Schools distribute information about age-appropriate memetic risks.

**Communities and Subcultures:** Illegal persona cultivation groups meeting secretly. Mutualist persona advocacy movements arguing for legalization and regulation. Anti-memetic purists who avoid all but essential exposures. Cracker enthusiast communities with sophisticated taste hierarchies. Response team veteran support networks. Online forums discussing memetic experiences and safety practices. Some subcultures deliberately seek out edgy or risky memetic content.

**Professional Ethics:** Dart artists debate the morality of their profession. Cracker composers argue about commercialization versus artistic integrity. Response teams maintain tight-knit communities with strong ethical codes about acceptable risk and collateral damage. Memetic researchers face IRB scrutiny for human subjects research involving memes.

**Religion and Philosophy:** Traditional religions exist but now understood as massive-scale egregores with complex psychofaunal ecosystems. Some religious practitioners deliberately cultivate specific egregoric relationships. Philosophical debates about the nature of consciousness extend to include memetic entities. Questions about rights and moral status of personae and egregores remain unresolved.

## Historical and Archaeological Context

Ancient civilizations may have been destroyed by memetic catastrophes. Archaeological sites require memetic safety protocols. Artifacts with geometric patterns, repetitive structures, or unusual linguistic features are treated as potential hazards. Excavation teams include memetic safety officers. Some sites are permanently sealed or destroyed if contamination risk is too high.

Historical records from pre-memetic-awareness periods are studied carefully. Some cultural practices may have been containment protocols that lost their original purpose over generations. Oral traditions about "dangerous knowledge" or "forbidden songs" are investigated as possible references to memetic hazards.

The transition to memetic awareness occurred gradually over the late 20th and early 21st centuries as information technology increased transmission speeds and patterns became more visible. Some researchers argue memetic hazards have always existed but only became acute with modern communication density.

## Natural Immunity and Variation

Approximately one in one hundred thousand individuals shows strong natural immunity to broad classes of memetic hazards. These individuals are valuable as spook recruits but experience profound isolation from inability to experience normal memetic content including beneficial crackers. They often cannot understand why certain art, music, or social experiences affect others so strongly.

Memetic susceptibility varies across populations and individuals based on neurological differences, cultural background, prior exposure history, and genetic factors. Some cognitive profiles show resistance to specific memetic classes while being more vulnerable to others. This creates complex risk landscapes that memetic epidemiologists attempt to map and predict.

Acquired resistance develops from repeated sub-threshold exposures, similar to immune system training. Response team inoculation programs deliberately use this mechanism but require careful dosing to avoid contamination or burnout.

## Open Questions and Ambiguities

Whether personae are conscious remains unresolved and deliberately ambiguous. Legal frameworks and safety protocols function without needing to answer this question definitively, though some jurisdictions are considering "memetic personhood" legislation.

The relationship between memetic hazards in this world versus psychological phenomena in baseline reality is interpretable as either literal difference or metaphorical intensification. Both readings are valid and the world's internal logic supports either interpretation.

The mechanism behind soul-forging remains mysterious. Only a handful of documented cases exist. Whether it can be deliberately induced or remains a unique accident is unknown. Some dart artists theorize about it but attempting to recreate the conditions is extremely dangerous.

Some ancient memes may still be dormant in archaeological sites, texts, oral traditions, or encoded in cultural practices whose original purpose has been forgotten. The full extent of historical memetic catastrophes is unknown and may be unknowable given the antimemetic properties some hazards possess.

Whether memetic hazards represent evolved biological vulnerabilities, emergent properties of information systems, artifacts of consciousness itself, or something else entirely remains a matter of scientific and philosophical debate within the world. Competing theories exist with different empirical support.

The theoretical upper limit of memetic danger is unknown. Civilization-ending hazards are suspected to exist but may be impossible to study safely. Some researchers believe in "basilisk-class" memes that could cause extinction-level events. Others argue the evidence for such entities is weak. Spook teams hunting these theoretical hazards operate under extreme secrecy.

## Technology and Memetic Interactions

Digital systems can carry and transmit memes but with varying fidelity. Algorithms that recommend or curate content become part of memetic transmission chains. Social media platforms require memetic safety officers. Some companies develop AI systems to screen for dangerous memetic patterns before they reach users, though these systems have controversial accuracy.

Virtual and augmented reality create new transmission vectors. Immersive experiences can carry more potent memes than flat media. VR memetic safety is an emerging field with incomplete understanding of risk factors.

Brain-computer interfaces are treated with extreme caution given their potential to bypass normal cognitive defenses. BCIs that could enable direct memetic transmission between minds are heavily regulated and largely hypothetical.

Memetic encryption and authentication techniques exist to verify cracker origins and prevent tampering. Digital signatures for memetic content help track provenance and identify contaminated or pirated versions.
