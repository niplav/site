# Do Games Get Longer or Shorter as Players Get Better?

**Bottom line**: **Mixed patterns** - some games show defense-favoring trends (chess, soccer, StarCraft) while others like basketball show strong offense-favoring patterns at higher skill levels.

## Key findings

**Chess**: Higher-rated players play longer games (more moves). Microsoft Research's analysis of 12 million games found games systematically increase in length with rating.

**Soccer**: Elite leagues average 2.6-2.9 goals per game versus higher scoring in lower-tier leagues. Longer periods between "rounds" (goals) at professional levels.

**Basketball**: NBA games have much higher scoring per minute (2.19) than college games (1.7), showing offense-favoring trends at elite levels.

**StarCraft II**: Professional players show decreased early rush frequency compared to lower skill levels, leading to longer average game duration.

## Findings table

| Game/Sport | Metric | Skill Effect | Offense-Defense Shift | Source |
|------------|--------|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Chess** | Game length (moves) | **↑ Longer** | **↓ Defense** | Microsoft Research¹ |
| **Soccer** | Goals per game | **↓ Fewer** (2.6-2.9 elite vs higher amateur) | **↓ Defense** | CIES Observatory² |
| **Basketball** | Points per minute | **↑ Higher** (NBA: 2.19 vs NCAA: 1.7) | **↑ Offense** | Multiple sources³ |
| **StarCraft II** | Rush frequency | **↓ Less** rushing, longer games | **↓ Defense** | Thompson et al.⁴ |
| **Boxing** | Activity ratios | **→ More consistent** (elite maintain patterns) | **↔ Neutral** | Thomson et al.⁵ |

## Data limitations

Most game research focuses on playing *style* rather than basic duration/scoring metrics. The available data is frustratingly sparse for such a straightforward question. Many domains lack systematic collection of skill-stratified game length data.

## Pattern

**Mixed results**: 3 games show defense-favoring patterns (chess, soccer, StarCraft) while basketball shows strong offense-favoring trends. The pattern may depend on game structure - turn-based and sports with discrete scoring events tend toward defense, while continuous action games favor offense at higher skill levels.
