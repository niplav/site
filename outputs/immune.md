## Key Observations

**Biggest gaps:**
- **Brains**: No macro→macro functions at all - brains can't directly interface with other brains
- **Organisms**: Inter-organism cellular invasion exists (transmissible cancers) but is rare due to immune defenses
- **Companies/Markets**: Individual→institutional attacks exist (industrial espionage, insider threats) but are heavily defended against

**Pattern**: The gaps often reflect evolutionary/structural constraints rather than impossibilities. Transmissible cancers show that cellular invasion between organisms is possible but rare due to immune defenses. Systems with more centralized control (brains) have fewer bottom-up invasion capabilities compared to distributed systems (memeplexes, nation-states).

**Speculative biology**: The neural parasite concept would fill multiple MISSING cells by creating:
- Organism macro→micro invasions (neural colonies taking over cellular systems)
- Brain macro→macro invasions (direct neural network colonization)
- Brain micro→macro invasions (parasitic neurons hijacking executive control)

**Real-world precedent**: Transmissible cancers (DFTD, canine venereal tumors) prove that cellular invasion between organisms is evolutionarily possible, suggesting the neural parasite concept has biological plausibility.
