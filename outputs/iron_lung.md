The iron lung stands still  
On Smithsonian's hill  
No more children gasping air  
No more summers filled with fear  
When pools and parks lay dead  
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread  

Raise your droplets high  
Two drops that testify  
To Sabin, Salk who led the way  
And millions vaccinated, they  
Built immunity round  
If nothing else was ever fixed, they drove this terror down  

Yet headlines seldom show  
How close we are to go  
They speak of variants unknown  
Of vaccine trust overthrown  
And myths that carry on  
New fears may rise to take its place, but this one's nearly gone  

Some still resist the shot  
Though history forgot  
When parents lived in summer's fear  
Of paralysis drawn near  
To steal their children's breath  
But nation after nation chose to spare them from this death  

The iron lung stands still  
On Smithsonian's hill  
No more children gasping air  
No more summers filled with fear  
When pools and parks lay dead  
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread  
Oh no!  
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread!
