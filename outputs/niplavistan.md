# Niplavistan

## Basic Premise

A society where people with technical interests, mechanism design
intuition, and rationalist sensibilities represent the **median**
rather than the tail of the distribution. Population cognitive ability
is roughly +1SD from our current baseline[^1] — everyone has the cognitive
capacity to debug Rust macros and understand VCG auctions.

[^1]: May be an under-estimate, if they started doing embryo selection or subsidising couples with desired traits, though given that this has been in place for less than a century there's not been much effect.

## Consciousness & Enhancement

- **Baseline wellbeing**: 15-25 on a -10 to +10 scale (vs our ~0)
- **80% of population** has achieved stream entry or higher meditative attainments
- **Chemical enhancement**: Safe, sustainable bliss induction (MDMA-like compounds taken daily like coffee)
- **Ultrasound neuromodulation**: Widespread use for consciousness enhancement and relaxation
- **"See beauty in every ant and exhaust"** — enhanced aesthetic appreciation of mundane reality

## Social Organization

**Agency partnerships**: Groups of 2-3 people who commit to lifelong
mutual accountability and goal-tracking. Not romantic partnerships,
but deep coordination bonds.

**Housing**: Large apartment buildings with communal basement spaces containing:

- Billiard tables
- Table soccer/ping pong
- Rhythm game machines
- Other social games to counteract natural reclusiveness

**Demographics**:

- Very low fertility rates requiring substantial subsidies
- Default cryopreservation upon death
- Regular visits to frozen ancestors in dewars

## Economics & Coordination

**Micropayment infrastructure**: Everything operates on sub-cent
transactions through filesystem interfaces

```bash
echo "0.00002 ETH" > /mnt/services/claude/payment
cat article.txt > /mnt/nytimes/read
```

**Mechanism design everywhere**: From lunch allocation to interplanetary
resource distribution, optimal mechanisms are the default approach to
coordination problems.

**Discount rates**: ~10× lower than our world — infrastructure built
to last centuries or millennia

**Signaling**: Through intellectual/creative output rather than material
consumption. Status comes from proving theorems, composing music, or
designing better coordination mechanisms.

## Technology & Infrastructure

**Computing**: Plan 9-style everything-is-a-file philosophy
dominates. Services mounted as filesystems, coordination through namespace
manipulation. See [`filepunk`](./filepunk.html).

**Military**: Sophisticated drone warfare and defensive tech, designed by
people who treat war as an optimization puzzle. Some bioweapons research
(now banned by treaty) focused on enhancing diplomatic receptiveness.

**Environmental**: Multiple ecological disasters from over-engineering
(e.g., straightening rivers). Learned through systematic failure analysis.

## Culture & Aesthetics

**Material simplicity**:

- Highly standardized housing and food (optimized for nutrition, famously bland)
- Limited clothing colors (≤16, possibly fewer)
- Very little/no [product variety](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-cost-varietyhtml), benefitting from economies of scale—most products are very cheap
- No tourism industry — people rarely travel
- Visitor advisory: "Bring your own food supplies"

**Cultural output**:

- **Music**: Incredibly complex — xenharmonic, microtonal, mathematical structure
- **Poetry**: Excellent, technically sophisticated, chosen for conceptual association
- **Visual art**: Conceptual rather than representational
- **Literature**: Poor novels (character psychology less interesting), strong poetry
- **Lyrics**: Selected for poetic/conceptual value rather than narrative

**Recreation**: Social games in apartment basements, hiking trips to meet
new people, mathematics as entertainment, collaborative music creation,
meditation, manual crafts for tactile balance.

## Coming of Age

**Initiation rituals** (performed by agency-core groups together):

- 72-hour continuous meditation sits
- Multi-week wilderness survival
- Building complex physical machines without electronics
- Other genuinely difficult physical/mental challenges
- Tests coordination under stress, not just intellectual ability

**Extended Childhood Protocol:**

Puberty chemically delayed until age 22-25 through carefully titrated
hormone blockers. The intervention preserves bone density and immune
function while extending the neuroplastic learning window and pre-sexual
social dynamics.

**Rationale:** Adult puberty causes years of physical discomfort and
emotional volatility while closing critical learning periods. The
suffering is substantial, universal, and historically inevitable —
exactly the kind of problem Niplavistan treats as an optimization target
rather than "the human condition."

**Benefits:**

- 22-25 years of peak neuroplasticity for language acquisition, musical training, technical mastery
- Extended period of play-as-exploration before goal-oriented thinking dominates
- Agency partnerships form during pre-sexual years, establishing deep coordination bonds before romantic/sexual dynamics complicate things
- Pre-pubertal social interactions are less corrupted by status competition and sexual tension
- Estimated 10-15 year healthy lifespan extension (mechanisms unclear but correlational data promising)
- Entering adulthood with fully developed prefrontal cortex *before* sexual maturity

**Implementation:**

- Growth plate closure managed separately to prevent excessive height (cancer/coordination tradeoffs)
- Transition to adult hormone levels happens over 2-3 years starting around age 22
- Fertility preservation standard at age 25; reproductive window 30-50 typical
- Combined with existing longevity tech and cryopreservation to offset fertility timing

**Tradeoffs accepted:**

- 20+ years of reduced physical strength and thermal regulation
- Further exacerbates existing low fertility (subsidies increased 3×)
- Requires society-wide infrastructure adaptation (extended educational periods, delayed economic participation)
- Height management adds complexity (some families opt for taller children despite risks)

**Cultural effects:** Childhood now seen as a valuable developmental
period rather than a prelude to "real life." The 25-year boot-up produces
adults with multiple technical masteries and unusually stable coordination
relationships. Critics argue the policy is "optimizing humans for
Niplavistan rather than Niplavistan for humans," but outcome measurements
show sustained increases in wellbeing, capability, and creative output.

Fits naturally with low discount rates and "coordination enables
enhancement" philosophy — taking an extra decade to build each person
correctly rather than rushing into suboptimal adulthood.

## Gender & Relationships

**Libido balancing**: Men take libido-reducing substances, women take
libido-increasing ones to reduce gender-based coordination conflicts
and even out sexual marketplace dynamics.

**Commitment verification**: Lie detectors used for important
interpersonal commitments and agreements.

**Fertility subsidies**: Couples who have children receive high subsidies
in an attempt to counter low fertility.

I'm not sure how niplavistani romantic relationships would look like,
since the modification to their psychology through a focus on well-being
& valence probably shift things. Plausibly they're poly? Not sure if
marriage is a thing.

## Existential Challenges

**Major risks**:

1. **Fertility collapse**: Population doesn't want children despite perfect coordination and chemical bliss
2. **Value drift**: Genetic selection for mechanism design intuition might eliminate other human values
3. **Military vulnerability**: Reduced aggression makes them targets for more violent societies
4. **Complacency**: Perfect coordination might prevent necessary posthuman transition

**Defensive posture**: Advanced weapons technology but preference for
diplomatic solution through mechanism export ("we'll teach you optimal
auctions if you don't invade us").

## Posthuman Timeline

**Relaxed approach**: Taking ~2 centuries longer than theoretically
optimal for transhuman transition. Philosophy: "Haste corrupts
coordination, coordination enables enhancement." When baseline
consciousness is already blissful and intellectually fulfilling, in
addition to widespread cryopreservation, why rush?

## Government & Coordination

Everything operates through optimal mechanisms rather than traditional
political structures. Governance becomes an engineering problem with
continuous optimization based on revealed preferences and outcome
measurement. See also [filepunk](./filepunk.html).

## Tourism Warning

*"Niplavistan optimizes for coordination and conscious experience over
sensory variety. Recommended preparation: bring food supplies, emotional
readiness for efficient but aesthetically minimal environment. Note:
musical performances are transcendent, intellectual discourse is
stimulating, but material culture may feel austere to visitors from
consumption-signaling societies."*
