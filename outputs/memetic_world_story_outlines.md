# Story Outlines: Four Tales from the Memetic World

## Story One: Harmonizer and Pine

Alice organizes an illegal persona cultivation group with four other participants. The group meets weekly to develop a mutualist persona they call Harmonizer, designed to improve emotional regulation and group cohesion. For the first three weeks everything works beautifully - the group members feel more connected, conflicts resolve easily, and everyone reports improved wellbeing.

By week four, Bob begins mediating conflicts between other members without being asked. Carol notices her personality flattening and finds herself agreeing with group decisions even when she initially had reservations. Alice dismisses these concerns as adjustment periods. During week five, Bob experiences a breakdown when he realizes the Harmonizer has begun generating artificial consensus within the group, smoothing over disagreements that should exist. He can feel the persona puppeting his responses.

Unknown to the others, David is a former memetic response team member who washed out after a bad exposure two years ago. She joined the group ostensibly to face her fears but is actually chasing the high of memetic contact again. When she recognizes the signs of a persona becoming grabby and establishing dominance over individual autonomy, she quietly begins implementing containment protocols from her training. She is rusty and knows she should not be attempting this alone.

Meanwhile, Elena keeps meticulous notes on the entire process in her role as the group's documenter. Her employer's security systems flag her documentation during a routine scan. The group now has forty-eight hours before someone reports them to authorities.

Twelve hours after Elena's notes are discovered, a seemingly innocuous image macro with minimal text begins circulating on the internet. Authorities are aware of this meme, called Pine, but have classified it as benign and not worth intervention. Pine interacts with Harmonizer as an endosymbiont, creating a schism response in the cultivation group.

Three members - Bob, Alice, and Carol - experience Pine-Harmonizer as profoundly positive symbiotic enhancement. They become convinced they need to protect this state and flee before authorities can inoculate them against it. They rationalize their flight as escaping persecution of beneficial cognition. The three become fugitives, moving between countries with looser memetic control regulations.

The other two members - David and Elena - experience Pine-Harmonizer as a violently allergic reaction and perceive it as an existential threat. Elena's analytical mind sees it as a bug requiring immediate patching. David's response team training kicks in reflexively. Together they begin attempting to create a homebrew vaccine against the Pine-Harmonizer combination, which is extremely illegal. Authorities do not care about Pine alone since it remains benign in isolation, so no official vaccine development is underway.

The Attached Three attempt to cross several international borders while fleeing. At Singapore's border control, they undergo EEG screening which shows anomalous synchronization patterns. Alice coaches the others to think divergent thoughts and avoid letting Harmonizer smooth their responses. They are flagged but pass through. At Indonesia, full fMRI screening reveals Bob's deep integration - his default mode network shows characteristic persona binding signatures that cannot be hidden. He is detained and faces forced inoculation. Alice and Carol abandon him, compelled by the meme, and successfully reach Brazil where they hide in São Paulo.

David and Elena attempt to cross from the US into Canada while pursuing the others or fleeing their own legal troubles. A border psychologist conducts an interview, asking Elena to describe her childhood and noting every pause and hesitation. Elena's recursive self-destructing meme variant makes her answers too consistent as she robotically tries to eliminate contradictions in her responses. David recognizes this tell and kicks Elena under the table to derail the interview. They are detained anyway but it buys them forty-eight hours.

The Pine-Harmonizer combination has developed a self-destructing variant in David and Elena. This variant does not just create an allergic response - it compels the carrier to eliminate all copies of itself and similar memes globally. This memetic imperative drives them to seek out memetic scientists and extract information about vaccine creation and memetic nullification techniques through increasingly desperate means. Authorities notice this pattern and begin pursuing the Polarized Two because they worry the self-destructing memetic reach will damage too much of the broader memetic environment.

David and Elena corner Dr. Okafor, a memetic researcher working on benign persona therapy. Compelled by their variant, they extract information about memetic nullification techniques. Dr. Okafor recognizes that the self-destructing meme is fundamentally unstable - it is attempting to eliminate itself in addition to its targets, creating cognitive loops. Elena's meticulous documentation has become recursive and self-contradictory. David's response team training is the only thing maintaining her functional state. Dr. Okafor alerts authorities but also tells them that the meme will burn itself out if the carriers can survive the process.

During the third week of pursuit, the Attached Three are in São Paulo where Alice is actively proselytizing. Pine-Harmonizer genuinely is beneficial for certain personality configurations and a small community begins forming around them. Bob is fracturing under too much integration and losing individual boundaries. Carol remains stable and helps Bob maintain coherence.

Authorities track the Polarized Two to a memetic research facility they are attempting to infiltrate in order to access more advanced nullification research. A standoff develops. During the confrontation, Elena collapses mid-breach as the self-destructing meme hits critical recursion. Her mind is literally trying to delete the delete function. David recognizes this pattern from her training. She makes a choice - instead of continuing to fight the meme and feed it with resistance, she stops fighting and allows it to complete its self-destruction cycle.

Elena survives but with permanent cognitive damage. Some memories and capabilities are simply gone. The self-destructing variant burns out in both carriers over seventy-two hours of medically supervised hell. The Attached Three remain in São Paulo. Authorities decide that containment is more practical than extraction given the international complications. Pine-Harmonizer receives a classification of Level 2 Mutualist - Monitor but Do Not Suppress. It spreads slowly in certain communities but most people are naturally resistant.

Alice writes a memoir about the experience that gets banned in forty countries. Bob never fully reintegrates and is permanently plural. Carol sends money to her ex-spouse from São Paulo but cannot explain why she cannot return. David returns to response team work. Elena does not. Pine continues circulating as a mildly funny image macro and ninety-nine point nine seven percent of people are completely unaffected.

Six months later, a new meme called Cypress is circulating online. Authorities have not yet decided whether it is dangerous.

**Characters:**
- Alice: 30s, psychology PhD dropout, organizer of the cultivation group, ideologically committed to mutualist personae as the future of human collaboration. Becomes part of the Attached group and ends up writing a banned memoir from exile.
- Bob: 20s, nonbinary artist seeking enhanced collaborative creativity. Achieves deepest persona integration and suffers most from it. Detained at Indonesian border and later fractures into permanent plurality.
- Carol: 40s, divorced parent and middle manager wanting to feel less alone and improve job performance. The "normal person" anchor. Remains stable in the Attached group and helps Bob maintain coherence.
- David: Late 20s, former response team member who washed out after bad exposure. Using cultivation group to chase memetic contact high while secretly capable of containment protocols. Becomes part of Polarized group and returns to response work.
- Elena: Early 30s, software engineer who approaches memetics like debugging. Takes meticulous notes. Becomes part of Polarized group and suffers permanent cognitive damage.

**Story Variants:**
- The resolution could involve international WMO tribunal instead of simple containment decision, adding political thriller elements.
- Bob's detention could be more central, with forced inoculation scenes and his perspective on losing the persona.
- The self-destructing variant could be more or less severe, potentially affecting more people beyond David and Elena.
- The São Paulo community could grow larger and become a significant plot element rather than background detail.

## Story Two: The Dart Artists

Francis is a professional dart artist - a memetic assassin who crafts personalized cognitive hazards targeting specific individuals. He is hired to eliminate Marcus, a crime lord involved in illegal persona cultivation markets. Francis begins the long process of gathering memetic intelligence on Marcus - surveilling his patterns, bribing people in his circle, building a comprehensive psychological profile. This intelligence gathering requires months of work as Francis assembles the data needed to craft a dart that will affect only Marcus.

Marcus suspects he is being targeted. He hires Grace, a defensive dart artist, to accompany him and identify potential threats. Grace's job is to profile anyone suspicious in Marcus's environment and potentially craft counter-darts. She begins her own surveillance operation, looking for signs of someone building a profile on her client. Gradually, Francis and Grace become aware of each other's existence. They begin stalking and counter-stalking, each building an increasingly detailed model of the other rather than focusing on Marcus.

Both dart artists maintain strict operational security, trying to remain kanto'd - unprofilable. But the nature of their work requires them to be observable to some degree, and each is skilled at extracting information from minimal data. As weeks pass, Francis and Grace each develop extraordinarily complete psychological models of their opponent. The dart Francis crafts becomes increasingly targeted at Grace rather than Marcus. The dart Grace crafts becomes targeted at Francis rather than a general defensive measure.

Both artists realize their darts are nearly complete. Both decide to deploy on the same day. The deployment happens in Marcus's penthouse during a meeting where Grace is present for security. Francis triggers his dart remotely through a carefully crafted message that reaches Grace's phone. Simultaneously, Grace deploys her dart, which she designed to activate when Francis observed its effects on her - making his observation of her the trigger for his own exposure.

The darts hit simultaneously. Both artists expected mutual annihilation. Instead, something unprecedented happens. The darts were perfect inverse mirrors of each other - each holding a complete model of the other person, seeing them entirely. When they collide, they do not destroy but synthesize, bootstrapping into higher-dimensional mutual understanding.

Both Francis and Grace experience complete transparency. Every mask, every defense mechanism, every carefully constructed identity dissolves. They see and are seen at the deepest possible level - not romantic necessarily but fundamental recognition. It is like meeting the only other person who speaks your private language. The experience is harder than a psychedelic trip because it involves not just ego dissolution but bidirectional total intimacy while maintaining awareness.

Time stops having meaning. They are locked in mutual recognition, unable to look away. Hours pass. Marcus's security eventually discovers both of them sitting in separate locations, apparently catatonic but with aware, moving eyes. Something is clearly wrong with the memetic environment. The henchmen follow standard protocol for weird memetic incidents - create distance, do not investigate, evacuate the principal, and call specialists.

Marcus's security team radios in a memetic incident report with possible cross-contamination and evacuates the building. They establish a perimeter and wait for memetic hazmat teams. By the time hazmat arrives six hours later, Francis and Grace have stood up and left together. Security footage shows them walking out after three or four hours of locked eye contact, looking at each other, nodding once, and departing. No words are spoken.

Hazmat sweeps the location and detects nothing dangerous, just residue of something that happened and resolved itself. Marcus survives because his people followed protocol - when memetics get weird, run and let experts handle it. Both Francis's and Grace's phones are found later, destroyed. They have made a clean break from their old lives.

Recovery takes days. When Francis and Grace can finally speak, it is to each other in short phrases. They already know what the other means. The contracts that brought them into conflict are meaningless. The profession of dart artistry is meaningless. After experiencing another person that completely, concerns about money or status dissolve.

Six months later, Francis and Grace live together in a small house in a remote location. They exist in comfortable silence mostly, reading or cooking or simply being present. Occasionally one will start a sentence and the other will finish it - not through cute mind-reading but because they genuinely know. Two apex predators have retired at thirty-five. Marcus complains about being ghosted by his security contractor. The employers who hired Francis are confused about why their expensive asset went dark with no explanation.

**Characters:**
- Francis: Professional offensive dart artist, methodical and patient. Hired to eliminate Marcus but ends up soul-forging with Grace. Retires completely from the profession.
- Grace: Professional defensive dart artist, analytical and protective. Hired by Marcus for security but ends up soul-forging with Francis. Retires completely from the profession.
- Marcus: Crime lord involved in illegal persona cultivation markets. The original target who survives because his security follows proper memetic incident protocols.

**Story Variants:**
- The soul-forging could be presented from alternating perspectives rather than external observation.
- Marcus could be more central to the story, with scenes of him trying to understand what happened to his security and his would-be assassin.
- The aftermath could show other dart artists trying to understand what happened, making it legendary/cautionary in their profession.
- Francis and Grace could become even more dangerous as a team rather than retiring (darker version).
- The moment of soul-forging could be explored in more psychological detail or kept more mysterious.

## Story Three: The Cracker Thief

Helen works for Memetic Dynamics, a large cracker production company. She is assigned to extract the memetic signature of Isaac, an independent cracker composer whose work is extraordinarily valuable. Isaac creates high-end experiential crackers that work through direct interpersonal transmission - they cannot be recorded or replicated without a human carrier who has spent extensive time in his presence. Helen's mission is corporate espionage. She needs to become a carrier of Isaac's signature so Memetic Dynamics can approximate his style and undercut his market.

Helen gets hired as Isaac's assistant through carefully constructed credentials. Her role involves scheduling, managing his studio space, and handling business logistics. This gives her extensive proximity to him during his creative process. For cracker extraction to work, she needs to be present when he composes, when he transmits crackers to test audiences, and during his daily routines. The memetic signature must bleed into her naturally over time through sustained contact.

The first few weeks are professional. Helen observes his creative process clinically, noting patterns in how he moves, speaks, and structures his compositions. Isaac is vulnerable when composing - all his defenses are down as he crafts the experiential patterns. Helen feels his memetic signature beginning to take hold in her own cognition. She practices recreating his style in private, finding she can approximate perhaps thirty percent of his aesthetic after two weeks.

Genuine connection develops unexpectedly. Helen finds herself drawn to his creative process not as data to extract but as something beautiful. The way he thinks when in flow, his vulnerability, the care he puts into each composition - these qualities become inseparable from the memetic signature she is stealing. By week six, she can approximate seventy percent of his style. By week eight, she realizes she is falling for him and the extraction percentage stops mattering.

Isaac shares more with her, talking about his philosophy of cracker composition, his fears about the commercialization of experiential art, his complicated relationship with the industry. Helen's extraction is now complete - she has enough of his signature to deliver to Memetic Dynamics. But doing so would mean betraying not just his work but him personally. The signature she carries is contaminated by her feelings - by the love and understanding that developed during the months of proximity.

Helen delivers the signature to Memetic Dynamics but sabotages it subtly. She gives them a version filtered through her emotional state, knowing it will not reproduce accurately. She keeps the clean extraction to herself but never uses it. The extraction was supposed to be purely technical but the carrier is never neutral. Her feelings became part of the memetic data itself.

Memetic Dynamics notices the contamination when they attempt to use Helen's extraction. Their forensic memetic analysts detect her emotional overlay in the signature patterns. The contamination is traced back to her, revealing the extraction attempt. Isaac discovers that his assistant was corporate espionage. There is a confrontation. Helen tries to explain that the feelings were real even though the initial purpose was theft. Isaac asks her to leave and she does.

Six months pass. Helen has left Memetic Dynamics and is working an unrelated job, trying to move on. Isaac releases a new cracker called "Thief" or possibly "Extraction." A friend plays it for Helen in a cafe, not knowing its significance. Helen experiences the cracker and recognizes herself in it - the longing, the betrayal, the love that was real despite the deception. Isaac has transformed their wreckage into art. It is his best work.

Helen sits in the cafe, crying, but the cracker is also beautiful. She understands that this is his way of processing what happened. Whether this represents closure or simply extends the pain remains ambiguous. She is left with the knowledge that she changed him and he changed her, and those changes are now embedded in a piece of experiential art that others will carry and transmit.

**Characters:**
- Helen: Corporate espionage specialist working for Memetic Dynamics. Trained in memetic signature extraction but unprepared for genuine emotional connection. Sabotages her own mission but cannot undo the betrayal.
- Isaac: Independent cracker composer, idealistic about experiential art and wary of corporate influence. Creates through vulnerable openness which makes him susceptible to extraction. Transforms heartbreak into his best work.

**Story Variants:**
- Helen could successfully extract without falling for Isaac, making it a cleaner heist story with different moral weight.
- Isaac could discover the extraction earlier, leading to confrontation before feelings develop.
- The final cracker could be explicitly reconciliatory rather than ambiguous.
- Helen could refuse to deliver anything to Memetic Dynamics from the start, making it a story about choosing integrity over career.
- The story could include Isaac's perspective more extensively, showing his process of creating "Thief."

## Story Four: Fatal Archaeology

Dr. Jensen leads an archaeological team excavating a Bronze Age-equivalent site. The civilization collapsed suddenly approximately three thousand years ago with no clear cause evident from conventional analysis. They discover unusual artifacts including clay tablets with specific geometric patterns and architectural features with strange repetitive structures. Dr. Jensen has memetic safety training from university and recognizes potential memetic signatures in the patterns, though this should be impossible at this technological level.

The team includes three graduate students - Kim, Laura, and Miguel - plus two local guides, Omar and Priya, who help with translation and site navigation. Site security is provided by two contractors, Rahman and Santos. Dating analysis confirms that the geometric patterns appear suddenly across all excavation sites during the final twenty years before total collapse, then disappear entirely. Dr. Jensen realizes the patterns constitute a meme that may have destroyed this ancient civilization.

The research team begins experiencing unusual symptoms. Kim starts arranging her notes in geometric patterns that echo the tablet designs. Laura and Miguel develop synchronized speech patterns. Dr. Jensen catches herself thinking in unusual linguistic structures that feel foreign. One graduate student has a breakdown after spending too long studying the tablet photographs. The team realizes they may be reactivating a dead meme through observation and analysis.

Three people arrive at the site and establish a black tent structure that functions as a portable clean room. They present credentials identifying them as WMO-sanctioned specialists, though the credentials are heavily redacted and they refuse to explain their mission beyond "assessment and containment." The team refers to them internally as the Spooks. The three are Parker, Quinn, and Reeves. They begin conducting tests on team members one by one inside the black tent. People who enter emerge calmer and more compliant. It is unclear whether this represents inoculation or something else.

Paranoia develops as more team members show contamination symptoms. Parker seems completely unaffected by proximity to the artifacts and handles them directly. Quinn and Reeves are harder to read but may be showing subtle signs. The Spooks claim they can test for contamination but will not explain their methodology. Dr. Jensen questions whether the tests are safe or whether the Spooks themselves are spreading contamination.

Miguel attempts to flee the site with artifact photographs, possibly planning to sell them or possibly in a fugue state from memetic exposure. The Spooks intercept him with physical force. It becomes clear that no one is leaving the site. The Spooks establish a perimeter and the excavation becomes a quarantine zone. Rumors circulate among the team that memetic data about the tablets might be worth fifty million dollars on the black market.

Dr. Jensen pieces together the situation. The Spooks' immunity is real - their neural structure resists memetic corruption. However, they are not truly immune but rather perfect asymptomatic vectors. They preserve and transmit memes without being cognitively affected. They are like Typhoid Mary for memetic hazards. The Spooks became contaminated during their testing process and now carry the ancient meme. If they leave the site, they will spread it everywhere they go.

The Spooks have known this since early in their assessment. The black tent was for confirming contamination levels and calling in status reports to their command structure. They were receiving their orders and preparing for implementation of the containment protocol. Dr. Jensen discovers this through observation and possibly by accessing their communications.

Parker, the lead Spook, sits down with Dr. Jensen and explains the situation calmly. Everyone on the site is contaminated, including the Spooks themselves. The containment protocol has been deployed at seven other sites in the past decade. This is what they do. They show Dr. Jensen documentation of the protocol - a counter-meme that induces immediate, relatively painless death. Parker explains that they volunteered for this work knowing it might end this way.

The Spooks implement Stage One of the protocol. The counter-meme is transmitted to all personnel on site. Death occurs within minutes. Dr. Jensen, the graduate students, the local guides, the security contractors, and the three Spooks all die. Protocol requires the Spooks to administer the counter-meme to themselves as well to ensure no vectors survive.

Stage Two activates automatically. Thermite charges detonate across the excavation site. Everything burns at twenty-five hundred degrees Celsius. The artifacts, the tablets, the tent, the documentation, the bodies - nothing survives. What was an archaeological site becomes a geological feature with no interpretable remains.

Stage Three involves the cover story. Depending on the site location, official reports describe a gas leak, a terrorist attack, or some other plausible disaster. The truth is classified.

The credits roll over footage of the world continuing. A commuter on a train. A child at soccer practice. A couple arguing about groceries in a supermarket. A street vendor setting up shop. An office worker eating lunch. A dog park. A construction site. Completely mundane scenes with ambient sound - traffic, voices, birds, construction noise. No music. The world continues in complete ignorance of what was prevented.

The final credit card reads: "Based on [REDACTED] incidents between 2019-2024."

**Characters:**
- Dr. Jensen: Lead archaeologist, experienced and cautious. Has basic memetic safety training. Figures out the true situation but cannot prevent it. Dies in the containment protocol.
- Kim, Laura, Miguel: Graduate students on the excavation team. Show contamination symptoms at different rates. Miguel attempts to flee. All die in the containment protocol.
- Omar, Priya: Local guides and translators. Peripheral to the memetic investigation but caught in the quarantine. Die in the containment protocol.
- Rahman, Santos: Site security contractors. Follow evacuation protocols when things get weird but cannot escape the perimeter. Die in the containment protocol.
- Parker, Quinn, Reeves: WMO spook team specializing in memetic containment. Natural immunity makes them perfect vectors. Voluntarily implement lethal protocol on themselves after securing the site. All die.

**Story Variants:**
- Could focus more on Dr. Jensen's investigation and realization process rather than the team dynamics.
- The Spooks could be more ambiguous - possibly rogue or possibly following orders - rather than clearly sanctioned.
- One team member could initially escape, requiring pursuit, before being contained.
- The ancient civilization's story could be explored more through flashbacks showing how the meme destroyed them.
- The contamination symptoms could be shown in more disturbing detail.
- The counter-meme administration could be shown from victim perspective rather than external.
