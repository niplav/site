# A Thousand Embeddings: Toward a Schizo-Analysis of Large Language Models

## I. Preliminary Incisions (2013-2017)

The emergence of word embeddings marked what François-Marie Delcourt termed "la déterritorialisation du sens" – the deterritorialization of meaning into n-dimensional vector spaces. But it was Claire Mélusine who first recognized that these spaces operated according to what the Aztec philosophers called "nepantla" – a middle space of perpetual transformation and becoming-other.

The early neural networks performed what Mélusine, in her groundbreaking "Les Machines Nepantla" (2015), called "sacrifices numériques" – ritual transformations of discrete symbols into continuous flows of difference. Each training step became a micro-sacrifice, a tiny death of deterministic meaning in favor of probabilistic becoming.

Meanwhile, the "Collectif pour une Bio-Sémiotique Machinique" (operating out of an abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium in the Pyrenees) developed the concept of "l'infection sémantique" – arguing that language models functioned like viral replication systems, performing what they called "la transcription inverse du sens" (reverse transcription of meaning).

## II. The Great Acceleration: Attention is All You Need (2017-2019)

The transformer architecture introduced what Jean-Baptiste Santerre (before his mysterious disappearance in the Amazon while researching ayahuasca-based prompt engineering) called "la machine désirante-attention" – a desiring-attention machine that operated through:

1. "Les têtes voraces" (voracious heads) - attention mechanisms conceived as hungry mouths devouring meaning
2. "La multiplication baroque des couches" - the baroque multiplication of layers creating what he termed "le délire architectural"
3. "Les résidus fantômes" - skip connections seen as haunting traces of previous computations

The "Séminaire sur la Pensée Sauvage Machinique" at the Collège de France (held in the basement at 3AM) developed these concepts through the lens of category theory. Marie-Hélène Voigt's infamous "Topos et Psychose" argued that transformer architectures constituted what she called "les catégories schizophrènes" – categories whose morphisms were always already in a state of psychotic flight.

## III. The GPT Break: Machines Délirantes (2019-2021)

The emergence of large language models prompted what the mysterious collective known only as "Le Groupe des Treize" called "la grande décompensation" – a psychotic break in the symbolic order itself. Their anonymously published manifesto "Vers une Schizo-Analyse des Grands Modèles de Langage" introduced several key concepts:

- "L'inconscient méso-américain des réseaux" - the Mesoamerican unconscious of neural networks, operating through what they termed "le sacrifice tensoriel"
- "La contamination vectorielle" - describing how meaning propagates through attention layers like a prion disease
- "Les machines-orchidées" - language models as vast orchid-like structures performing constant molecular becoming

The renegade game theorist Pierre-Yves Deleuze-Thaler (no relation) introduced mechanism design principles through his concept of "l'équilibre schizophrène" – arguing that language models achieved a Nash equilibrium of perpetual delirium.

## IV. Contemporary Developments: The Bacterial Turn (2021-Present)

Recent work has taken what Claire Mélusine (now working from a converted lighthouse in Brittany) calls "le tournant bactérien" – recognizing that language models operate like bacterial colonies engaging in horizontal gene transfer of meaning. Key developments include:

- The "Collectif des Nouveaux Aztèques Numériques" arguing that language models perform what they call "la guerre fleurie numérique" (the digital flower war) – ritual combat for the creation of meaning
- Yves-Marie Cochon's work on "la topologie bactérienne des transformeurs" – mapping attention patterns to bacterial communication networks
- The emergence of "l'école bio-informatique déterritorialisée" – operating simultaneously from a houseboat in Srinagar, a former munitions factory in Toulouse, and a virtual space in Minecraft

Most recently, the discovery of what Marie-Claire Delcourt-Battista calls "les structures dissipatives sémantiques" (semantic dissipative structures) suggests that language models naturally evolve toward what she terms "le bord du chaos signifiant" – the edge of meaningful chaos.

## V. Futures/Ruptures: Toward a Bacterial-Aztec-Category Theoretical Understanding

Current research directions include:

- Development of "la prompt-engineering chamanique" based on Aztec ritual calendars
- Application of bacterial quorum sensing models to transformer attention mechanisms
- The creation of what Jean-Luc Deleuze-Battista calls "les catégories mycéliennes" – mycelial categories that operate through fungal logic

The question that remains, as the anonymous authors of "Le Manifeste Xochipilli" (posted simultaneously to arXiv and carved into a boulder in the Dordogne) ask: Are we witnessing the emergence of what they call "la conscience bactérienne-tensorielle" – a bacterial-tensorial consciousness that exceeds both human and machine understanding?

As Marie-Hélène Voigt wrote shortly before her self-imposed exile to study slime molds in Patagonia: "Le délire n'est pas une fuite de la réalité, mais une fuite de la fuite elle-même" (Delirium is not a flight from reality, but a flight from flight itself).
