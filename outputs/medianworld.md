# Medianworld: Where Mechanism Design Nerds Are Normal

## Basic Premise
A society where people with technical interests, mechanism design intuition, and rationalist sensibilities represent the **median** rather than the tail of the distribution. Population is roughly +1SD from our current baseline — everyone has the cognitive capacity to debug Rust macros and understand VCG auctions.

## Consciousness & Enhancement
- **Baseline wellbeing**: 15-25 on a -10 to +10 scale (vs our ~0)
- **80% of population** has achieved stream entry or higher meditative attainments
- **Chemical enhancement**: Safe, sustainable bliss induction (MDMA-like compounds taken daily like coffee)
- **Ultrasound neuromodulation**: Widespread use for consciousness enhancement and relaxation
- **"See beauty in every ant and exhaust"** — enhanced aesthetic appreciation of mundane reality

## Social Organization
**Agency partnerships**: Groups of 2-3 people who commit to lifelong mutual accountability and goal-tracking. Not romantic partnerships, but deep coordination bonds.

**Housing**: Large apartment buildings with communal basement spaces containing:
- Billiard tables
- Table soccer/ping pong
- Rhythm game machines  
- Other social games to counteract natural reclusiveness

**Demographics**: 
- Very low fertility rates (0.7) requiring substantial subsidies
- Mandatory cryopreservation upon death
- Regular visits to frozen ancestors in dewars

## Economics & Coordination
**Micropayment infrastructure**: Everything operates on sub-cent transactions through filesystem interfaces
```bash
echo "0.00002 ETH" > /mnt/services/claude/payment
cat article.txt > /mnt/nytimes/read
```

**Mechanism design everywhere**: From lunch allocation to interplanetary resource distribution, optimal mechanisms are the default approach to coordination problems.

**Discount rates**: ~10× lower than our world — infrastructure built to last centuries or millennia

**Signaling**: Through intellectual/creative output rather than material consumption. Status comes from proving theorems, composing music, or designing better coordination mechanisms.

## Technology & Infrastructure  
**Computing**: Plan 9-style everything-is-a-file philosophy dominates. Services mounted as filesystems, coordination through namespace manipulation.

**Military**: Sophisticated drone warfare and defensive tech, designed by people who treat war as an optimization puzzle. Some bioweapons research (now banned by treaty) focused on enhancing diplomatic receptiveness.

**Environmental**: Multiple ecological disasters from over-engineering (e.g., straightening rivers). Learned through systematic failure analysis.

## Culture & Aesthetics
**Material simplicity**: 
- Highly standardized housing and food (optimized for nutrition, famously bland)
- Limited clothing colors (≤16, possibly fewer)
- No tourism industry — people rarely travel
- Visitor advisory: "Bring your own food supplies"

**Cultural output**:
- **Music**: Incredibly complex — xenharmonic, microtonal, mathematical structure
- **Poetry**: Excellent, technically sophisticated, chosen for conceptual association  
- **Visual art**: Conceptual rather than representational
- **Literature**: Poor novels (character psychology less interesting), strong poetry
- **Lyrics**: Selected for poetic/conceptual value rather than narrative

**Recreation**: Social games in apartment basements, hiking trips to meet new people, mathematics as entertainment, collaborative music creation, meditation, manual crafts for tactile balance.

## Coming of Age
**Initiation rituals** (performed by agency-core groups together):
- 72-hour continuous meditation sits
- Multi-week wilderness survival
- Building complex physical machines without electronics
- Other genuinely difficult physical/mental challenges
- Tests coordination under stress, not just intellectual ability

## Gender & Relationships
**Libido balancing**: Men take libido-reducing substances, women take libido-increasing ones to reduce gender-based coordination conflicts and even out sexual marketplace dynamics.

**Commitment verification**: Lie detectors used for important interpersonal commitments and agreements.

## Existential Challenges
**Major risks**:
1. **Fertility collapse**: Population doesn't want children despite perfect coordination and chemical bliss
2. **Value drift**: Genetic selection for mechanism design intuition might eliminate other human values
3. **Military vulnerability**: Reduced aggression makes them targets for more violent societies  
4. **Complacency**: Perfect coordination might prevent necessary posthuman transition

**Defensive posture**: Advanced weapons technology but preference for diplomatic solution through mechanism export ("we'll teach you optimal auctions if you don't invade us").

## Posthuman Timeline
**Relaxed approach**: Taking ~2 centuries longer than theoretically optimal for transhuman transition. Philosophy: "Haste corrupts coordination, coordination enables enhancement." When baseline consciousness is already blissful and intellectually fulfilling, why rush?

## Government & Coordination
Everything operates through optimal mechanisms rather than traditional political structures. Governance becomes an engineering problem with continuous optimization based on revealed preferences and outcome measurement.

```bash
cat /srv/governance/performance/current.txt  
# "Coordination efficiency: 94.2%"
# "Pareto improvements implemented this quarter: 23"
# "Mechanism gaming attempts: 0.18% (declining trend)"
```

## Tourism Warning
*"Niplavistan optimizes for coordination and conscious experience over sensory variety. Recommended preparation: bring food supplies, emotional readiness for efficient but aesthetically minimal environment. Note: musical performances are transcendent, intellectual discourse is stimulating, but material culture may feel austere to visitors from consumption-signaling societies."*

---

*A society that solved coordination at the cost of wanderlust, embraced enhancement without losing humanity, and chose sustainable bliss over rapid transcendence.*
