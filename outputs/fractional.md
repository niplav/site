# Fractional Commutative Hyperoperators: Investigation

*Generated by Claude (Sonnet 4.5) on 2025-10-13*

## Motivation

We want to find whether commutative hyperoperators can be extended to fractional ranks (e.g., operation 2.5, halfway between multiplication and commutative exponentiation) that would:

1. Complete the "triangle of power" at each level
2. Allow fractional operations like ⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x) analogous to nth roots
3. Enable mean relationships at all levels analogous to arithmetic ↔ geometric mean

## Background: What Exists

### Fractional Iteration Theory

**Schröder's Equation** provides a framework for fractional iteration:
- For function f with fixed point and multiplier s
- Solve: Ψ(f(x)) = s·Ψ(x)
- Then fractional iterates: f^(t)(x) = Ψ^(-1)(s^t · Ψ(x))

**Abel's Equation**: α(f(x)) = α(x) + 1
- Related to Schröder via: Ψ(x) = s^(α(x))
- Also gives fractional iteration

### Existing Work on Fractional Hyperoperators

- Fractional tetration has been studied extensively
- Extension to real/complex numbers was proved in 2017
- Active research area in functional equations
- Stack Exchange discussion mentions using "Schröder-mechanism" for fractional iteration heights with commutative hyperoperators

### Ghalimi's Construction

The commutative hyperoperators are defined:
```
⊕₀(x, y) = log(exp(x) + exp(y))
⊕₁(x, y) = x + y
⊕₂(x, y) = x × y
⊕₃(x, y) = exp(log(x) × log(y))
⊕ₙ(x, y) = exp(⊕ₙ₋₁(log(x), log(y)))  [for n > 3]
```

**Key property we proved**: ln(⊕ₙ(x, y)) = ⊕ₙ₋₁(ln(x), ln(y))

**Open question from Ghalimi**: Can we define ⊕ₙ for n ∈ ℝ or ℂ?

## Proposed Approaches

### Approach 1: Direct Interpolation

Define ⊕_{n+t} for 0 < t < 1 using a smooth interpolation that satisfies:

1. **Continuity**: ⊕ₙ should vary continuously with n
2. **Recursion**: ⊕_{n+1}(x, y) = exp(⊕ₙ(log(x), log(y)))
3. **Commutativity**: ⊕_{n+t}(x, y) = ⊕_{n+t}(y, x)

**Naive attempt**: Linear interpolation in the transform space?
```
⊕_{n+t}(x, y) = exp((1-t)·⊕_{n-1}(log(x), log(y)) + t·⊕ₙ(log(x), log(y)))
```

**Problem**: This probably doesn't preserve the recursive structure or other properties.

### Approach 2: Via Schröder's Equation

For a fixed y, consider the function:
```
fᵧ(x) = ⊕ₙ(x, y)
```

Try to solve Schröder's equation for this function, then use that to define fractional operations.

**Challenge**: The multiplier and fixed point structure may not be straightforward.

### Approach 3: Fractional Composition

The recursive structure suggests:
```
⊕ₙ₊₁ = exp ∘ ⊕ₙ ∘ (log × log)
```

Can we define "fractional composition" of the exp and log operations?

If we could define exp^(t) for 0 < t < 1 (fractional iteration of exp), then:
```
⊕_{n+t} = exp^(t) ∘ ⊕ₙ ∘ (log × log)^(t)
```

**But**: Fractional iteration of exp is notoriously difficult because exp has no fixed point in ℝ.

### Approach 4: Power Series Extension

For small arguments, expand ⊕ₙ(x, y) as a power series in log(x) and log(y), then interpolate the coefficients smoothly as functions of n.

**Challenge**: Ensuring convergence and preserving properties.

## What We Need for the "Triangle of Power"

At each level n ≥ 3, we want:
```
          ⊕ₙ(x, y)
          /        \
         /          \
    ln(·)  ←→  ⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x)
```

Where ⊕ₙ^(1/k) is a kth "root" operation satisfying:
```
⊕ₙ(⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x), ..., ⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x)) = x  [k times]
```

**Critical property needed**:
```
ln(⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x)) = (1/k) · something related to ln(x)
```

This would allow the mean relationship:
```
exp(generalized_mean_{n-1}(ln(odds))) = generalized_mean_n(odds)
```

## Specific Test Cases

### Case 1: ⊕_{2.5} (between multiplication and commutative exp)

We want ⊕_{2.5} such that:
- ⊕_{2.5}(⊕_{2.5}(x, y), ⊕_{2.5}(x, y)) ≈ ⊕₃(x, y)
- ⊕_{2.5}(x, y) is between x×y and exp(log(x)×log(y))
- ln(⊕_{2.5}(x, y)) = ⊕_{1.5}(ln(x), ln(y))

**Computational test**: For x=2, y=3:
- ⊕₂(2, 3) = 6
- ⊕₃(2, 3) = exp(log(2)×log(3)) ≈ 1.933
- ⊕_{2.5}(2, 3) should be ≈ 3.29 (geometric mean of 6 and 1.933)

### Case 2: Square Root Operation

For ⊕₃ (commutative exponentiation), what is ⊕₃^(1/2)?

We want: ⊕₃(⊕₃^(1/2)(x), ⊕₃^(1/2)(x)) = x

So: exp(log(y)×log(y)) = x where y = ⊕₃^(1/2)(x)
Therefore: y = exp(√(log(x)/log(y)))

This is an implicit equation! We'd need to solve for y.

## Open Questions

1. **Existence**: Do fractional commutative hyperoperators exist that satisfy all desired properties?

2. **Uniqueness**: If they exist, are they unique? (Fractional iteration often has non-unique solutions)

3. **Analyticity**: Can they be extended to a holomorphic function of n?

4. **Computation**: Can they be computed efficiently? (Might require numerical solution of functional equations)

5. **Triangle structure**: Do fractional operations automatically give us the "third vertex" of the triangle at each level?

6. **Mean relationships**: If we can define fractional operations, do we automatically get generalized mean relationships?

## Plausible but Unproven Conjecture

**Conjecture**: There exists a family of operations ⊕ₙ for n ∈ ℝ, n ≥ 0, such that:

1. ⊕ₙ₊₁(x, y) = exp(⊕ₙ(log(x), log(y))) for all n
2. ⊕ₙ is continuous in n
3. ⊕ₙ is commutative and associative for all n
4. For integer n, ⊕ₙ agrees with Ghalimi's construction

**If true**, this would enable a "tower of triangles" with mean relationships at every level.

**But**: Proving existence and constructing it explicitly are major open problems.

## Where to Look Next

1. **Tetration forums** and research communities studying fractional tetration
2. **Papers on functional equations** - especially those using Schröder/Abel methods
3. **Numerical methods** - try to compute ⊕_{2.5} numerically and see if it has nice properties
4. **Complex analysis** - analytic continuation might be the right framework
5. **Ghalimi himself** - the Observable notebooks might have more details or he might be interested in this question

## Relation to Original Question

This investigation was sparked by observing:
- The "triangle of power" (exp, log, √) at the exponentiation level
- Distributivity: log(a×b) = log(a) + log(b)
- These together enable: exp(arith_mean(log(odds))) = geom_mean(odds)

For this pattern to extend to all levels with commutative hyperoperators, we need **both**:
1. ✓ Distributivity at all levels (we proved this)
2. ? Fractional operations to complete the triangles (still open)

## Status: Partially Solved

- **What exists**: Theory of fractional iteration (Schröder, Abel)
- **What's proven**: Fractional tetration exists (2017)
- **What's unclear**: Whether Ghalimi's construction extends smoothly to fractional ranks
- **What's missing**: Explicit formulas and computation methods
- **What's really missing**: The connection to generalized means at each level

This appears to be **novel mathematics if properly worked out**, though the ingredients exist in the literature. The specific question of whether fractional commutative hyperoperators complete the "triangle of power" at each level seems unexplored.

## Recommendation

This deserves a proper mathematical investigation, possibly:
1. A computational exploration (try to construct ⊕_{2.5} numerically)
2. An analytical approach using functional equations
3. Reaching out to researchers in fractional iteration / tetration

If this works out, it would be a beautiful unification of:
- Generalized means (Hölder)
- Commutative hyperoperators (Ghalimi)
- Fractional iteration (Schröder/Abel)
- The arithmetic-geometric mean connection

## Update: Clarifying Two Distinct Problems

*Added 2025-10-13 after further discussion*

We realized there was confusion between two different notions of "fractional":

### Problem 1: Fractional Hyperoperator Ranks
Finding operations ⊕_{n+t} for non-integer n+t (like ⊕_{2.5}, halfway between multiplication and commutative exponentiation).

**Status**: Theoretically possible via Schröder/Abel methods, no explicit formulas known for Ghalimi's construction.

### Problem 2: Root Operations at Each Level
For each integer level n, finding an operation ⊕ₙ^(1/k) that acts like an "nth root" does for exponentiation.

**Key requirement**: ln(⊕ₙ^(1/k)(x)) should relate nicely to ln(x), allowing mean calculations.

**Status**: Unknown whether this is even possible.

### The Triangle Structure

At the exponentiation level (n=2), we have a **triangle of power**:
```
        exp(x)
       /      \
      /        \
   log(x)  ←→  x^(1/n)
```

With the crucial property: `log(x^(1/n)) = (1/n)·log(x)`

This property enables: `exp(arithmetic_mean(log(odds))) = geometric_mean(odds)`

**For higher levels**, we'd need analogous triangles:
```
          ⊕ₙ(x, y)
          /        \
         /          \
    ln(·)  ←→  ⊕ₙ^(1/k)(·)
```

### Two Paths Forward

**Path A: Via Fractional Ranks**
- Define ⊕_{n+t} for all real n
- Hope that this automatically gives us root operations ⊕ₙ^(1/k)
- **Challenge**: No explicit construction known

**Path B: Define Roots Directly**
- At each integer level n, separately define what ⊕ₙ^(1/k) means
- Don't require fractional ranks between levels
- **Challenge**: Unclear if this is possible with current structure

### The Complex Number Obstacle

For n ≥ 4, commutative hyperoperators enter the complex domain:
- ln(ln(2)) < 0, so we need complex numbers
- Complex logarithms are multi-valued (branch cuts)
- Complex roots are multi-valued (n different nth roots)
- The triangle relationships might only hold for specific branch choices

**Possible simplification**: Restrict to positive reals x, y > e?

For x, y > e:
- ⊕₃(x, y) stays real and positive
- ⊕₄(x, y) = exp(⊕₃(ln(x), ln(y))) might stay real
- Need to verify this computationally

### What We Actually Know

**Proven**:
1. Distributivity holds at all levels: ln(⊕ₙ(x, y)) = ⊕ₙ₋₁(ln(x), ln(y))
2. This works even in ℂ (by construction)

**Unknown**:
1. Whether fractional ranks exist with nice properties
2. Whether root operations ⊕ₙ^(1/k) can be defined
3. Whether these would complete the triangle structure
4. Whether this enables mean relationships at higher levels

### The Deep Question

The arithmetic-geometric mean relationship works because of **two independent structures**:
1. **Distributivity**: log(a×b) = log(a) + log(b)
2. **Triangle**: log, exp, and roots interrelate via log(x^(1/n)) = (1/n)·log(x)

We have (1) at all levels for commutative hyperoperators.

**Open question**: Can we construct (2) at all levels?

This might require:
- Novel mathematics
- Numerical experimentation
- Better understanding of fractional iteration
- Or it might simply be impossible

### Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Computational experiments**:
   - Try to numerically construct ⊕_{2.5}
   - Test whether it has nice properties
   - Check if it gives us root operations

2. **Restrict to reals**:
   - Work out the structure for x, y ∈ ℝ₊ first
   - Only extend to ℂ if the real case works

3. **Contact experts**:
   - Tetration forum researchers
   - Ismael Ghalimi (creator of the construction)
   - Functional equations specialists

4. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Maybe the triangle structure requires different hyperoperators?
   - Could there be a different construction that naturally includes roots?

### Current Assessment

**Likelihood of success**: Uncertain but worth exploring

**Potential impact**: High - would unify several mathematical structures

**Difficulty**: Significant - requires solving open problems in fractional iteration

**Time investment**: Weeks to months of serious mathematical work

This is a promising research direction but not a quick win.
