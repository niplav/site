Services
=========

I am available for hire to do consulting, especially research consulting
and to a lesser degree computer programming and data science.

Contact me [here](./about.html#Contact) for inquiries.

Examples of my past paid work include [a library of forecasting
datasets](./iqisa.html) and [an analysis of range and forecasting
accuracy](./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html).

My rates are as follows:

* \$20/hr for work which I [was already planning to do myself](./todo.html), deem unusually important/good or just find very interesting (modeling the price after [Vasco Grilo](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/vascoamaralgrilo): "I typically ask for 20 $/h, which is roughly equal to 2 times the global real GDP per capita.").
* \$35/hr for work for which the final product will be public.
* \$50/hr otherwise.
