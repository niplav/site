Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/)
because most blogs are not organized by topic. But blog archives are
usually hard to navigate and it is often difficult to keep track of my
current position in the blog (especially with yearly/monthly wordpress
archives). To salvage this, I scrape blog archives and arrange them
chronologically.

* [Bit-Player Posts Chronological Index](./bp_chrono.md)
* [Overcoming Bias Posts Chronological Index](./ob_chrono.md)
* [Shtetl Optimized Posts Chronological Index](./so_chrono.md)
