Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/ "Start at the Beginning")
because most blogs are not organized by
topic. But blog archives are usually hard to navigate and it is often
difficult to keep track of my current position in the blog (especially
with yearly/monthly wordpress archives). To salvage this, I scrape blog
archives and arrange them chronologically.

* [Bit-Player Posts Chronological Index](./bp_chrono.md)
* [Overcoming Bias Posts Chronological Index](./ob_chrono.md)
* [Shtetl Optimized Posts Chronological Index](./so_chrono.md)
* [The Real Movement Posts Chronological Index](./trm_chrono.md)
