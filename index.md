Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/ "Start at the Beginning")
because most blogs are not organized by topic (tagging systems don't
count, don't be ridiculous). But blog archives are usually hard to
navigate and it is often difficult to keep track of my current position
in the blog (especially with yearly/monthly WordPress archives). To
salvage this, I scrape blog archives and arrange them chronologically.

* [Bit-Player Posts Chronological Index](./bp_chrono.md)
* [Overcoming Bias Posts Chronological Index](./ob_chrono.md)
* [Shtetl Optimized Posts Chronological Index](./so_chrono.md)
* [The Real Movement Posts Chronological Index](./trm_chrono.md)

Programming
-----------

* [awitt – Another Window Title Tracker](./awitt.md)

Miscellaneous
=============

* [About](./about.md)
* [Changelog](./changelog.md)
* [Contributions](./contributions.md)
* [Now](./now.md)
* [Todo](./todo.md)
* [Uses This](./uses_this.md)

### Media Consumption

I sometimes write reviews of things I have watched/read.

* [Text Reviews](./text_reviews.md)

The following is four lists on the content I consume. The content listed
there is a fairly big subset of what I actually read/listen to/watch,
but not complete. I also don't remember everything from these perfectly.

* [Texts List](./texts_list.md)
* [Movies List](./movies_list.md)
* [Podcasts List](./podcasts_list.md)
* [Series List](./series_list.md)
