Content
=======

If you take away one thing from this website, it
should be that I think [you would want to sign up for
cryonics](./considerations_on_cryonics.html) under careful deliberation.

This is the website of niplav. It contains essays on different topics,
including (but not limited to) programming, unusual social behavior and
philosophy, as well as translations and transcriptions of different texts,
recordings of music and programming projects. More information about
the website and its author can be found on the [about](./about.md) page,
for recent additions and changes, see the [changelog](./changelog.md).

Archives
--------

I try to read blogs completely, mostly [starting at the
beginning](https://entirelyuseless.com/2018/06/12/start-at-the-beginning/ "Start at the Beginning")
because most blogs are not organized by
topic. But blog archives are usually hard to navigate and it is often
difficult to keep track of my current position in the blog (especially
with yearly/monthly wordpress archives). To salvage this, I scrape blog
archives and arrange them chronologically.

* [Bit-Player Posts Chronological Index](./bp_chrono.md)
* [Overcoming Bias Posts Chronological Index](./ob_chrono.md)
* [Shtetl Optimized Posts Chronological Index](./so_chrono.md)
* [The Real Movement Posts Chronological Index](./trm_chrono.md)

-----------

* [Changelog](./changelog.md)

### Media Consumption

I sometimes write reviews of things I have watched/read.

* [Text Reviews](./text_reviews.md)

The following is four lists on the content I consume. The content listed
there is a fairly big subset of what I actually read/listen to/watch,
but not complete. I also don't remember everything from these perfectly.

* [Texts List](./texts_list.md)
* [Movies List](./movies_list.md)
* [Podcasts List](./podcasts_list.md)
* [Series List](./series_list.md)
