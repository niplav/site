Iqisa: A Library For Handling Forecasting Datasets
===================================================

Iqisa is a collection of forecasting datasets and a simple
library for handling those datasets. Code and data available
[here](https://github.com/niplav/iqisa).

So far it contains data from the [Good Judgment
Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Judgment_Project) and
code for handling the private [Metaculus](https://metaculus.com) data
(available to researchers on request to Metaculus), but I plan to also
add data from various other sources.

The documentation can be found [here](./iqisadoc.html), but a simple
example for using the library is seeing whether traders with more than
100 trades have a better Brier score than traders in general:

	import gjp
	import iqisa as iqs
	market_fcasts=gjp.load_markets()

	def brier_score(probabilities, outcomes):
		return np.mean((probabilities-outcomes)**2)

	def brier_score_user(user_forecasts):
		user_right=(user_forecasts['outcome']==user_forecasts['answer_option'])
		probabilities=user_forecasts['probability']
		return np.mean((probabilities-user_right)**2)

	trader_scores=iqs.score(market_fcasts, brier_score, on=['user_id'])
	filtered_trader_scores=iqs.score(market_fcasts.groupby(['user_id']).filter(lambda x: len(x)>100), brier_score, on=['user_id'])

And we can see:

	>>> np.mean(trader_scores)
	score    0.159194
	dtype: float64
	>>> np.mean(filtered_trader_scores)
	score    0.159018
	dtype: float64

Concluding that more experienced traders are only very slightly better
at trading.
