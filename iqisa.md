Iqisa: A Library For Handling Forecasting Datasets
===================================================

Iqisi is a collection of forecasting datasets and a simple library for
handling those datasets.

So far it contains data from the Good Judgment Project<!--TODO: link-->
and [Metaculus](https://metaculus.com), but I plan to also add data from
various other sources.

The documentation can be found [here](./iqisadoc.html).
