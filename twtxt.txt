2020-11-26T14:43:42.000000Z	I used to have a twitter, but then I got addicted to it and shut it down (https://twitter.com/niplavyushtun). I think I'll put similar stuff on here, and maybe more extreme experimental takes, because there's no risk of getting banned.
2020-11-26T15:06:04.000000Z	If it's not insightful enough for the LessWrong shortform, not in context enough for reddit, and not long enough for my website, it goes on here.
2020-11-26T15:06:56.000000Z	BTW, website! I can be found at https://niplav.github.io. If you want to read things I thought about for more than 5 seconds, that's the place to go.

2020-11-26T16:20:50.000000Z	Is the most efficient hedonium decreasing or increasing in supplied matter-energy?
2020-11-26T16:23:49.000000Z	That is, would total utilitarians build very small (& not very intensive) pockets of hedonium, or extremely big ones?
2020-11-26T16:24:15.000000Z	Or, in other words: would we have a repugnant conclusion?

2020-11-28T15:01:54.000000Z	Rationality is a set of mental motions. Meditation teaches to observe mental motions, and possibly methods to construct new ones.
2020-11-29T13:20:00.000000Z	Believing something doesn't mean you have to tell it to everyone

2020-11-30T10:46:42.000000Z	The upper class unconsciously wages class war against the lower classes through lax social laws, such as deregulation of drugs or teenage sexuality, which upper classes can cope with easily (higher discipline), but lower classes can't (and become criminal/addicted to drugs/pregnant at an early age/drop out of school early). This secures the upper class's position.

Thus: Relative conservativism, plus progression in direction of more cooperation, increasing option value/attainable utility. More concretely: Prevent wars, prevent extinction, freeze people, don't destroy ecosystems (for now). Possible flaws: Assumes we will be able to coordinate even better in the future. Seems more likely to me than not, but otherwise, flip the whole thing and go exploit on current morality.

2021-01-31T12:02:03.000000Z	(me making up words): qualia internalism: the properties of a quale are internal to the quale, and therefore the properties of different qualia can be projected onto a cardinal scale with zero point.
2021-01-31T12:05:30.000000Z	(cont): qualia relationism: the properties of qualia are defined by their relations to other qualia (but distinguish ordinal rankings for properties of qualia without a zero-point from cardinal properties of qualia without a zero-point). E.g., the hedonic treadmill is not accidental, but a deep fact of the universe.
2021-01-31T12:07:52.000000Z	challenge for qualia relationism: it seems plausible that for a relation between two qualia to be established to actually create the quality of the experience, they should occur at near points in time. however, people in great pain don't usually at the same time seem to recall memories of especially pleasurable moments.
