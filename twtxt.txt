2020-11-26T14:43:42.000000Z	I used to have a twitter, but then I got addicted to it and shut it down (https://twitter.com/niplavyushtun). I think I'll put similar stuff on here, and maybe more extreme experimental takes, because there's no risk of getting banned.
2020-11-26T15:06:04.000000Z	If it's not insightful enough for the LessWrong shortform, not in context enough for reddit, and not long enough for my website, it goes on here.

This secures the upper class's position.
