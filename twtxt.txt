2020-11-26T14:43:42.000000Z	I used to have a twitter, but then I got addicted to it and shut it down (https://twitter.com/niplavyushtun). I think I'll put similar stuff on here, and maybe more extreme experimental takes, because there's no risk of getting banned.
2020-11-26T15:06:04.000000Z	If it's not insightful enough for the LessWrong shortform, not in context enough for reddit, and not long enough for my website, it goes on here.
2020-11-26T15:06:56.000000Z	BTW, website! I can be found at https://niplav.github.io. If you want to read things I thought about for more than 5 seconds, that's the place to go.

2020-11-26T16:23:49.000000Z	That is, would total utilitarians build very small (& not very intensive) pockets of hedonium, or extremely big ones?
2020-11-26T16:24:15.000000Z	Or, in other words: would we have a repugnant conclusion?

2020-11-28T15:01:54.000000Z	Rationality is a set of mental motions. Meditation teaches to observe mental motions, and possibly methods to construct new ones.
2020-11-29T13:20:00.000000Z	Believing something doesn't mean you have to tell it to everyone

2020-11-30T10:46:42.000000Z	The upper class unconsciously wages class war against the lower classes through lax social laws, such as deregulation of drugs or teenage sexuality, which upper classes can cope with easily (higher discipline), but lower classes can't (and become criminal/addicted to drugs/pregnant at an early age/drop out of school early). This secures the upper class's position.

Thus: Relative conservativism, plus progression in direction of more cooperation, increasing option value/attainable utility. More concretely: Prevent wars, prevent extinction, freeze people, don't destroy ecosystems (for now). Possible flaws: Assumes we will be able to coordinate even better in the future. Seems more likely to me than not, but otherwise, flip the whole thing and go exploit on current morality.

2021-01-31T12:05:30.000000Z	(cont): qualia relationism: the properties of qualia are defined by their relations to other qualia (but distinguish ordinal rankings for properties of qualia without a zero-point from cardinal properties of qualia without a zero-point). E.g., the hedonic treadmill is not accidental, but a deep fact of the universe.
2021-01-31T12:07:52.000000Z	challenge for qualia relationism: it seems plausible that for a relation between two qualia to be established to actually create the quality of the experience, they should occur at near points in time. however, people in great pain don't usually at the same time seem to recall memories of especially pleasurable moments.

I don't particularly share that emotional intuition (although my bias probably cuts the other way: I am more moved by interesting projects, and more interesting problems probably also less neglected)–I generally find most problems other people find salient not very moving at all (although probably equally strongly moved by extremely near suffering compared to other people, but with a stronger emotional distance discount).

This might just be founder/sampling bias (life extension comes out of the relatively male dominated libertarian/techno-optimist cluster). Actually, maybe there's just a variance thing here: median man cares less about his longevity than the median woman, but the variance for men is higher.

2022-02-21T23:43:19.000000Z	Despite close connection in spirit [Chapin 2022, Cammarata 2021, Sotala 2019], few scholars have investigated the relation between microblogging and ancient buddhist scripture, especially the Tipitaka. However, multiple connections arise, for example the four brahmaviharas (the divine abodes) [Sujiva 2003, Buddhaghosa 500] and certain quaternionic spaces (or “tetraspaces”) [Minkowski 1908, Hamilton 1843, holomanga 2019], pointing at interesting connections between fourfold symmetries and benevolence [Gomez-Émilsson 2018]. In this essay I will
2022-02-22T00:22:55.000000Z	one thing niplav culture started doing very early was to group niplavs into group of 2-4 people who would form a worker/research unit (friendship encouraged, but romance discouraged). because of high agreeability, these units can be *very* stable, and are especially useful in trying to understand & solve difficult problems, often by one niplav being the babble and the other being the prune. this also has the advantage that for a niplav, intellectual work is around three times as fun in interaction with other niplavs, mainly because there is some very quick feedback mechanism that bores into weak points of understanding or sloppy parts of models/proofs, where a single niplav would just shrug and give up early.
2022-02-22T00:24:06.000000Z	an optimal session would be two niplavs at a whiteboard, either both thinking, or one explaining an idea to the other, and a third sitting at a laptop in the background and writing down the ideas as they're developed (and only sometimes asking questions for clarification).
2022-02-22T00:25:24.000000Z	the similarity to pair programming is not coincidental, but as in pair programming, this works best if the problem is actually quite difficult and critical, since otherwise it's not economically viable
2022-02-22T00:27:15.000000Z	niplav culture mostly acknowledges this, but takes the productivity hit by using these groups in settings where they're not necessarily optimal (although it is surprising how synchronized and fast a group of niplavs can be if they have been working together for a decade)
2022-02-22T00:30:06.000000Z	there has been a large amount of experimentation to find psychological characteristics of niplavs that are especially conducive for forming these kinds of groups or pairs, and a large portion of the teenage years of a niplav is spent in various different groups to find an especially well-functioning one.
2022-02-22T00:30:44.000000Z	these groups also work very well as ways of quickly organizing commitments, e.g. for meditation, exercise, artistic projects etc.
2022-02-22T00:33:31.000000Z	one disadvantage is the huge variety of interests a niplav can have, it is often not possible to find a pair/group where every niplav is at the same time interested in bebop, type theory, bouldering and forecasting. usually, this is solved by having one primary group that is broadly intellectual, and then side-projects, with elaborate rules about how to deal with these side-groups becoming more important than the main group.
2022-02-22T00:36:13.000000Z	this is less of a problem than one might suspect, because niplavs are generally easily made enthusiastic about most topics, niplavs are agreeable and willing to try the stuff other niplavs think are cool, motivated to stay in their group because they have grooved in a very strong rhythm, more capable of understanding why something is cool (because of short inferential distances), and the groups are carefully chosen to maximize potential common interests.
2022-02-22T00:40:20.000000Z	here im assuming that the distribution over people isn't just mean niplav, but also has less variance (but not so little that society immediately collapses, because just copies of niplav can't run a society)

(not success). (how do normal people handle interacting after one has romantically rejected the other? the ~2 times i have experienced it, it was always just __awkward__ and odd, is there no standard social script? when do you learn it?) if they do agree, you have another mess: others might still get jealous and call you a pest, with the standard hansonian dynamics voluminousifying, or leading to sliding into social bullshit; or there might be a less than optimal breakup that leads to one party not wanting to do X anymore. (not success). (this is furthermore worsened by the fact that you are probably not calibrated & smooth and can handle rejection well, or the other person can't handle rejecting well. oh well). so. if you go to an event about X because the gender ratio is good and you don't really care about X, then it is probably immediately and super clear that you are being *very* incongruous, and it's, like, not a great move? it feels very much like not a great move. so, this is the tree of badness for asking people at hobby events.

First, let's take meditation: every single moment in meditation is really Done after it's over, it doesn't linger around, the sensations don't pile up somewhere. They might influence each other, sure, but at the end of the day it's just the present experience, slashing into and out of existence in its clear luminosity.
2022-04-06T23:53:17.000000Z	second, there's predictions. a prediction is Done when it's made. you could add comments, explanations, models &c, but the prediction can be Done and stand there on its own. (there is a slight problem with the fact that predictions need to be updated over time, though, so there is some Piling there as well).
2022-04-06T23:54:49.000000Z	third, let's look at daygame. if you ask someone out in a social circle/hobby group, that leaves residual social cruft lying around: awkwardness & mutual avoidance. the whole thing is not Done the way it is when you get cleanly rejected on the street. (online dating has a similar quality of Doneness to it, I think, but matches might stack up and old leads might spring to life sometime, but that's the same with DG).
2022-04-06T23:56:16.000000Z	fourth, let's look at music, especially jamming. if you improvise, you are riding that same edge of time as with meditation, all music you create is there right now, and only the causal vibe carrying it all forward. that's why i mostly don't compose or record (also because my music is shit)
2022-04-06T23:57:33.000000Z	fifth, small & nifty programs. https://niplav.github.io/code/99_klong/sol.kg being exemplary, but i want to write some more code. every single function there is Done. there is only stuff to remove, if at all, and nothing to add.
2022-04-06T23:58:32.000000Z	Doneness is when something is temporarily finished, but if it is modified in any way, it is either fixed because the winds of time have buried under the bitrot, and it must be dug out, or because something was found that could be removed.
2022-04-06T23:59:37.000000Z	Piling, on the other hand, is when you have something that is infinitely extendable in scope and size, where every paragraph can have a subparagraph, every feature can be customizable, the dataset could be 10% bigger, the party could be a bit more extravagant, …, …, ……….
2022-04-07T00:01:36.000000Z	My website is very Piling. look at the todo list: https://niplav.github.io/todo.html! i can't tell you much about how it will look like in a year, but i can tell you that it won't shrink. it's piling. everything is piling up, forgotten drafts, half-finished experiments, buggy code—fixed over time, sure, but much more slowly than the errors come rolling in. it's an eternal struggle.
2022-04-07T00:03:09.000000Z	sometimes i think i should return to a cleaner state of mind, abandon all big never-to-be-finished projects, and write simple text-processing utilities on a raspberry pi running plan 9, improvising fractile jazz over a lonely lake and spend most of my remaining time meditating.

2022-05-03T14:11:05.000000Z	I think I understand why the US and central european countries have so different reactions to foreign interventions/participating in conflicts outside of ones own borders than the US: the US didn't experience the two world wars the way european countries did.
2022-05-03T14:15:35.000000Z	none of the two worldwars took place on US soil, and the US entered both conflicts relatively late, so there is less US cultural knowledge about them (mostly in the form of “relative X went overseas and died/came back traumatized”). but in europe, the countries were the place the WWs were happening. and they experienced a different way how those conflicts came to play: countries interfering in the affairs of other countries. this is more clear in the context of WWI: an austrian is shot in serbia, because serbia wants independence, but russia intervenes because it wants to control serbia, and germany & austria fight russia, and france has an alliance with russia, and germany always wanted to fight france anyway, ……… the level of intervention and trying to intervene in other countries' affairs leads to a chain reaction that brings about calamity.
2022-05-03T14:16:33.000000Z	on the other hand, the US comes in and there's already a conflict going on elsewhere, it's not quite clear why it's happening, but it looks like it's bad, so “we can go over there and shut up the bad guys” *star spangled banner blares*

2022-05-03T16:21:36.000000Z	we can't do it with cookies holding the private keys, since many people block cookie usage & cookies are readable by anyone. we'd need to have local storage that the server authenticates for, otherwise any server would be able to read out the private key from storage via js & send it to the attacking server…
2022-05-03T16:23:10.000000Z	but maybe there's some obscure way to route around those concerns?
2022-05-03T16:23:27.000000Z	but in that case, I'd worry about bugs in the obscure implementation of that feature.
2022-05-03T16:24:32.000000Z	how do whatsapp/signal/telegram desktop clients work? you'd basically either need to transfer the private key (in which case the encryption isn't e2e anymore?), or generate new keys for every device.
