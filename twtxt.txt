2020-12-18T08:42:02.000000Z	Would online dating without images lead to deeper, more human connections? I.e. only descriptions of people. If yes, is it different because of molochian reasons? More beautiful people have no problem showing their faces, so not showing ones face is seen as a low-status signal at some point. Counter: The idea of deeper, more human connections is in itself flawed, most mating choices are the result of a combination of class/status signals and physical attractiveness anyway.
2020-12-18T08:42:33.000000Z	Why does biology contain the field of ecology? This makes biology even bigger than it is already, ranging from biochemistry up to ecology. That would be like including sociology and medicine plus anthropology in one gigantic field of study.

2020-12-24T14:05:57.000000Z	I've always found the 'suicide is selfish' argument weird. Someone is making the most important (and most tragic) decision in their life, and people are talking about themselves?
2020-12-24T14:17:41.000000Z	Actually, embedded agency is a super good name for a movement, and I could see it replacing the horrid 'rationalism' over time. Plus, 'embags' is a really good abbreviation.

2021-01-04T10:20:21.000000Z	Greta Thunberg also is a nearly complete creation of the media, in the sense that we would never know about her if it were not for media.

2021-01-31T12:05:30.000000Z	(cont): qualia relationism: the properties of qualia are defined by their relations to other qualia (but distinguish ordinal rankings for properties of qualia without a zero-point from cardinal properties of qualia without a zero-point). E.g., the hedonic treadmill is not accidental, but a deep fact of the universe.
2021-01-31T12:07:52.000000Z	challenge for qualia relationism: it seems plausible that for a relation between two qualia to be established to actually create the quality of the experience, they should occur at near points in time. however, people in great pain don't usually at the same time seem to recall memories of especially pleasurable moments.

I don't particularly share that emotional intuition (although my bias probably cuts the other way: I am more moved by interesting projects, and more interesting problems probably also less neglected)–I generally find most problems other people find salient not very moving at all (although probably equally strongly moved by extremely near suffering compared to other people, but with a stronger emotional distance discount).

Women are more interested in longevity and happy that studies show that they live more than men." -> I probably could have been clearer: It seems to me that women are on average much less interested in life-extension (methods beyond usual health advice such as the old “exercise, eat vegetables”) than men. This might just be founder/sampling bias (life extension comes out of the relatively male dominated libertarian/techno-optimist cluster). Actually, maybe there's just a variance thing here: median man cares less about his longevity than the median woman, but the variance for men is higher.

2022-04-06T23:51:48.000000Z	there is this property of Doneness that I really like, and that tracks a lot (but not all) of my interests. First, let's take meditation: every single moment in meditation is really Done after it's over, it doesn't linger around, the sensations don't pile up somewhere. They might influence each other, sure, but at the end of the day it's just the present experience, slashing into and out of existence in its clear luminosity.
2022-04-06T23:53:17.000000Z	second, there's predictions. a prediction is Done when it's made. you could add comments, explanations, models &c, but the prediction can be Done and stand there on its own. (there is a slight problem with the fact that predictions need to be updated over time, though, so there is some Piling there as well).
2022-04-06T23:54:49.000000Z	third, let's look at daygame. if you ask someone out in a social circle/hobby group, that leaves residual social cruft lying around: awkwardness & mutual avoidance. the whole thing is not Done the way it is when you get cleanly rejected on the street. (online dating has a similar quality of Doneness to it, I think, but matches might stack up and old leads might spring to life sometime, but that's the same with DG).
2022-04-06T23:56:16.000000Z	fourth, let's look at music, especially jamming. if you improvise, you are riding that same edge of time as with meditation, all music you create is there right now, and only the causal vibe carrying it all forward. that's why i mostly don't compose or record (also because my music is shit)
2022-04-06T23:57:33.000000Z	fifth, small & nifty programs. https://niplav.github.io/code/99_klong/sol.kg being exemplary, but i want to write some more code. every single function there is Done. there is only stuff to remove, if at all, and nothing to add.
2022-04-06T23:58:32.000000Z	Doneness is when something is temporarily finished, but if it is modified in any way, it is either fixed because the winds of time have buried under the bitrot, and it must be dug out, or because something was found that could be removed.
2022-04-06T23:59:37.000000Z	Piling, on the other hand, is when you have something that is infinitely extendable in scope and size, where every paragraph can have a subparagraph, every feature can be customizable, the dataset could be 10% bigger, the party could be a bit more extravagant, …, …, ……….
2022-04-07T00:01:36.000000Z	My website is very Piling. look at the todo list: https://niplav.github.io/todo.html! i can't tell you much about how it will look like in a year, but i can tell you that it won't shrink. it's piling. everything is piling up, forgotten drafts, half-finished experiments, buggy code—fixed over time, sure, but much more slowly than the errors come rolling in. it's an eternal struggle.
2022-04-07T00:03:09.000000Z	sometimes i think i should return to a cleaner state of mind, abandon all big never-to-be-finished projects, and write simple text-processing utilities on a raspberry pi running plan 9, improvising fractile jazz over a lonely lake and spend most of my remaining time meditating.

2023-07-17T23:29:59.000000Z	instead of e.g. new linkers. why is there only one ImageMagick, or one ffmpeg, but ~6k programming languages? status.
2023-07-19T11:06:47.000000Z	are there any other industries in which we apply a similar safety standard as training of large neural networks? the closest that comes to my mind is animal husbandry, but I think we understand the genetics of that better than we understand neural networks, and don't apply ever-more increasing optimization power to it. (although, to be fair, when humans began husbandry they understood it far less)

2023-07-22T11:18:55.000000Z	output format of AI systems doing alignment research (formal proof, set of heuristics, set of algorithms…)? AI systems will align their successor systems, repeatedly. Unless this process has 100% fidelity, errors in the alignment process will compound over time, similar to numerical instability. Similar to numerical analysis, could we make a useful statement about the “condition number” of this repeated alignment process?
