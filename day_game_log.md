Day Game Log
============

Sessions
--------

Sessions are usually warm-up (collecting data for other projects, asking
for directions, compliments, directly asking men for their phone number)
and then main approaches, with notes on the quality of the interaction
and the result. At the end, I try to extract lessons and ideas for
improvement out of the session.
